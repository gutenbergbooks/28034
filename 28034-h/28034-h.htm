<h2><a name="NOTE_BY_THE_PUBLISHERS" id="NOTE_BY_THE_PUBLISHERS"></a>NOTE BY THE PUBLISHERS.</h2>


<p>In the year 1863, Rev. Rufus Anderson, D. D.,
senior Secretary of the American Board of
Commissioners for Foreign Missions, visited the
Hawaiian Islands on official business connected
with the missionary work of that institution.
He was accompanied, in that visit, by his wife
and daughter, the latter of whom preserved
some memoranda of the journey and the scenes
to which it introduced her, for the gratification
of her friends. From these notes the present
volume has been prepared. The interest which
the friends of missions in this country have
long cherished for that people&mdash;youngest born
in the family of Christian nations&mdash;will lead
them to welcome these unpretending sketches,
as affording both instruction and entertainment
to themselves and their children.</p>

From New York to Aspinwall.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">"T</span></span>ELL us a story, aunty,&mdash;tell
us a story," came in pleading
tones from a group of
children; and they watched
my face with eager eyes to
see if I looked willing.</p>

<p>"A story, children; what
shall it be about?"</p>

<p>"About the places you went to while you
were gone, and the people you saw."</p>

<p>"Now, aunty," said Carrie, who was one
of the older ones, "we are going to be here
a whole month, and if you will tell us a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
story every day, we shall know all about
your journey."</p>

<p>I thought the matter over for a few minutes.
"Well, children," said I, "I'll make
a bargain with you. If you will promise to
get your work done nicely every day by
four o'clock, I will tell you a story until tea-time."</p>

<p>"A bargain! a bargain!" shouted the
children.</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">It was winter when we went away, you
remember, though there was no snow on
the ground. We went on board the steamer
Ocean Queen, in New York, on the 12th
of January. Uncle George went down
with us, and what a crowd there was on the
wharf,&mdash;men and boys, coachmen and porters!
It was some time before our carriage
could get inside the wharf-gates, and when
I got out, it seemed as if horses' heads were
all about me; but seeing Uncle George was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
not afraid, I took courage, and keeping
close behind him, soon left the horses. I
found the people were worse than the
horses; but after many jostlings and pushings,
I got into the saloon, safe and sound,
all but a rent in my dress.</p>

<p>Grandma and I stayed there, while grandpa
and Uncle George went to look after the
baggage. Strangers were all around us,
and we couldn't tell who were our fellow-voyagers,
and who not. Soon one and
another of our friends came to say good-by.
It was all very much confused, and we were
glad finally when we were actually off.</p>

<p>Then I took a look at the stateroom
where we were to spend ten nights. What
a little box, almost too small to turn round
in!&mdash;and our berths had so little space between
them that we couldn't sit up at all.
We went to bed early, quite disgusted
with sea-life to begin with, and were wondering
how we could get along for ten days<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
thus cooped up, with hard beds, and not
much to eat; for we had had no dinner
that day, when&mdash;crash! a shock&mdash;and the
machinery stopped! What could it be?
Heads were popped out of staterooms, and
"What's the matter?" was in every mouth.
We had run into a small schooner, which
had imprudently tried to cross our bows.
For an hour there was noise overhead,&mdash;men
running across the deck; and then all
was still, only the thump, thump of our
engine; so we went to sleep, thanking our
Heavenly Father that no worse thing had
happened to us.</p>

<p>"Aunty," said Harry, "what became of
the poor schooner?"</p>

<p>We gave her one of our boats, and the
captain thought he could get her into port;
but she leaked badly, and I afterwards
heard he had to run her ashore on some
beach just out of New York.</p>

<p>Next morning, in my forgetfulness, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
attempted to sit up in my berth, and gave
my head a great bump on grandma's berth.
On the third night out we had a heavy gale,
and one of our sails was blown away with a
noise like that of a cannon.</p>

<p>"Aunty," said little Alice, "do steamers
have sails?"</p>

<p>Yes, we always had a sail on the foremast;
it steadies the ship, and if the wind is
right helps the vessel. Almost every body
was sea-sick during that gale, for it lasted
two days. We went scarcely a hundred
miles, and were off Savannah when it cleared
up.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know where Savannah is," said
Harry; "it was in my last geography lesson."</p>

<p>When Sabbath came, it was very rough,
so we could not have preaching. We sung
a few hymns, but were rather quiet, when
the cry, "Porpoises! porpoises!" made us
run to the side of the vessel; and sure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
enough, there was a whole school of them
rolling along in great glee. They are light
brown fishes, varying in shade, some four
feet long, some less. The female and young
keep side by side, and leap out of the water
at the same time. They jump out of the
white crest of one wave into the next, racing
along, seeming to try and keep up with
the ship. It was very exciting, and the
passengers shouted; for, excepting a few
birds, they were the first living thing out of
the ship we had seen for six days. All the
rest of that day we were running so near the
Florida coast that we could see the green
trees on shore. We could hardly believe
it was mid-winter. The water looked shallow,
and we grazed the end of a sand-bank,
after which they kept the vessel farther
from the shore. We saw some great green
sea-turtles that day; they were about three
feet long. Our wheel turned one over on
his back. I wanted to watch him; but we
soon left him far, far behind.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>We went round by the west of Cuba, to
keep out of the way of the pirate Alabama.
Monday morning, about nine o'clock, we
came in sight of a gunboat. Soon after
passing her, boom! went her cannon, and
we came to a stand-still. She sent her boat
with an officer, who came on board and
got newspapers. That gunboat is stationed
there to give warning of pirates, I suppose,
and she is required to stop every vessel.
The final excitement was left for Tuesday
morning, when we were near Cape San Antonio,
Cuba. While at breakfast, word
came that there were two steamers ahead.
It was whispered about that the larger was
the Alabama; so we all went on deck to get
a good look. Though they showed the
Union flag, we were rather suspicious of
them; and when they both started in pursuit
and fired their cannon, our captain
steamed in toward the land; for if vessels
get within three miles of a neutral shore, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
hostile craft can touch them. We came to
anchor in plain sight of Cuba's green hills,
and waited anxiously for our pursuers, who
had fired a second cannon. They both
lowered a boat. We feared we should see
the rebel rag, but were joyful when our
own stars and stripes were unrolled to the
breeze. The vessels proved to be the Wachusett,
Com. Wilkes's flag-ship, and the
gunboat Sonoma, Capt. Stevens. So there
ended our fright about pirates. For the
next two days we were sailing across the
Caribbean Sea, and on Friday, Jan. 23,
about eight o'clock in the evening, went
up Navy Bay to the wharf at Aspinwall.
It was too dark to see the groves of cocoa-nuts
on shore; so I had to wait for my view
of tropical trees until morning.</p>

<p>There is the tea-bell; so we shall have to
pause here until to-morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="II" id="II"></a>II.<br /><br />

Isthmus of Darien.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>S soon as the clock struck
four, Carrie, Alice, Willie,
and Harry reminded me of
my promise, and having all
finished their work, were
ready for story Number
Two.</p>

<p>"Aunty," said Carrie,
"Alice and I have finished our squares of
patchwork, and Willie and Harry have
weeded that flower-bed for grandpa; so
you see we have done our part of the
bargain, and now we have come for your
part."</p>

<p>I'm all ready for my part, said I.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Before we arrived at Aspinwall, old
travelers told us that if we got there before
ten at night, we should have to leave
the steamer and go to the hotels. We were,
therefore, selfishly relieved to find that all
the hotels had been burned to the ground
about Christmas time. So we stayed on
board the steamer that night, and how glad
we were to think it was our last night there.
We heard that the steamer upon which we
were to embark on the other side was a
very large one, and about five in the morning,
after a comfortless breakfast of poor
coffee without milk, and hard bread, we
turned our back on the Ocean Queen,
without regret. A stout, half-naked negro
shouldered our baggage, and we were
actually treading the soil of the Isthmus of
Darien.</p>

<p>"Did he carry your trunks, aunty?"
said Willie.</p>

<p>Oh, no, dear, we had our trunks all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
weighed the day before. We were only
allowed fifty pounds of baggage apiece, and
for all over that we had to pay ten cents for
every pound. They gave grandpa checks
for the trunks; so the man only took our
bags and deck chairs. He took what we
ourselves couldn't carry.</p>

<p>On the beach near us, was the stranded
wreck of the British ship Avon, a large,
noble vessel, lying on her side. In a gale
some time ago, she dragged her anchors, I
believe, and was blown by the wind far up
on the sand.</p>

<p>It was quite a picturesque scene at the
cars, in the early morning light. We
passed through a small grove of cocoa-nuts.
I really was disappointed in them; but
these were dwarf-trees, and not good samples.
The passengers were standing in
groups with their bags at their feet, or on
the head of some native near by. The cars
were before us, and native women passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
about with their waiters of fruit and
cakes. They were dressed in white or
light-colored muslin or calico skirts,
flounced, torn, and dirty; a white chemise,
with a ruffle round the neck trimmed with
lace, and a bandanna handkerchief tied
round the head completed their toilet. In a
picture it would look very well; as it was,
one dreaded too close a contact, they were
so dirty. Some of their attitudes were very
graceful. The men had on shirts and
pantaloons, the former generally worn as
a sack. After much scrambling, we were
seated in the cars, hot and disgusted.</p>

<p>"Hot, aunty, and in January too?" said
Carrie.</p>

<p>If you look on your map, you will find
that Aspinwall is not very far from the
equator. They have no winter there, and
the sun is very powerful.</p>

<p>Soon after we started, all other feelings
were lost in intense delight at the luxuriant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
tropical verdure about us. Aspinwall is on
a coral island close to the shore, and is low
and unhealthy. The name of the island is
Manzanilla. The natives call the town
Colon, from Columbus or Christoval Colon,
as his name is in Spanish. The railroad
was five years in being built, under almost
unheard-of difficulties; and any person
going over it might learn to appreciate
some of them, after seeing the rich, tangled,
luxuriant vegetation in the low, wet grounds.
How I longed to know the names of the
beautiful flowers fringing the road; but no
one could tell me. First we passed through
a swamp of purple and white azaleas; then
one of snowy callas; then near a bank
hidden from view by heavy morning-glory
vines in bloom, still dripping with dew.
We saw a great many specimens of what I
was told was the "long palm;" it looked to
me like a kind of brake or fern, with drooping
branches twenty feet in length. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
were trees with hardly a leaf; but each
branch and twig crowned with orange-yellow
blossoms. Again we would see a
tree covered with feathery, purple flowers.
Along some parts of the way, was a profusion
of "Indian shot," so called, I suppose,
because the seeds are black, hard, and
round, looking like large shot. Here and
there drooped a vine with brilliant scarlet
blossoms. Once in a while we would see
the deep green of the orange-tree, or the
lighter foliage of the lemon, and finally a
banana-tree, with its bunch of fruit, gladdened
my eyes. There were many trees
with parasitic plants growing on them,
looking as if ropes were hanging from them.
It is said that if one of these groves of ferns
on the Isthmus is cut down, in three months
the vegetation has grown so rapidly as to
look as if no human hand had ever interfered
with them. One wanted several pairs
of eyes to take in all the beauty of the
scene.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 373px;">

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>There were various way-stations upon
the railroad, having neat white houses, with
a piazza upon both stories. Before and
around some of them are pretty gardens,
with bright flowers, conspicuous among them
being our fragrant roses, such as rarely
bloom with us except in green-houses. We
passed many native huts grouped in small
villages, with their inhabitants sitting in the
doorway or lounging about the premises,
the children running round half naked or
entirely so. Most of these people are freed
Jamaica slaves. They seemed to be a happy
but indolent race. Fruits grow about them
with such prodigality as to require but little
exertion to obtain the necessities of life.
Their huts are made of bamboo rods,
thatched with palm-leaves.</p>

<p>But there is the tea-bell.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="III" id="III"></a>III.<br /><br />

Panama.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapc"><span class="dropcap">"C</span></span>OME, come, aunty," shouted
Willie, "the clock has struck
four; so put down your sewing,
and tell us about Panama.
We've finished our
work beautifully, grandma
says." So I began.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">When we reached Panama, about nine
o'clock, it was very warm and sultry.
The soil is sandy. Though the present
city of Panama is not more than two hundred
years old, it has an ancient and dilapidated
appearance. The climate is such
that even the stones decay, and worms destroy
the wood. The houses are all tiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
and look oddly enough. The tiles resemble
the half of an earthen water-pipe, and are
of a light brick-color. We had quite a
laugh on the wharf at our grotesque appearance,
likening ourselves to emigrants;
for our bags, chairs, shawls, and umbrellas
were all laid in a heap, and grandma and I
sat on them, while grandpa went off to
make arrangements for going on board the
steamer, or spending the day in the city.
The natives bowed before us with their baskets
of fruit, which they offered for sale.</p>

<p>"What fruit was it, aunty?" asked little
Alice.</p>

<p>Mangoes, pineapples, limes, oranges, and
bananas. They had also rolls, cakes, and
pies. Then some came with the native
wine, and with milk and lemonade, which
the man said was "nice lomonard!"</p>

<p>We decided to stay in Panama until afternoon,
when a small boat would take us off
to our noble steamship, the Constitution.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
We left our baggage at the station, and took
the railway omnibus, drawn by mules, which
were driven by a negro, up to the "first-class
hotel,&mdash;the Aspinwall House." He took us
a distance of half a mile, perhaps, at the
moderate charge of fifty cents apiece! The
streets of Panama are very narrow, and the
driver had to call out every once in a while
to clear the road, so that we might pass.
The hotel is built round a court. The parlor
is in the third story, and is quite comfortably
furnished, while from the walls
hang oil paintings, which, with their frames,
might in New York be worth two dollars
and a half apiece. Two long windows
opened out on a balcony, and commanded a
view of the hoary tiled roofs of the city.
There was a center-table in the room, which
interested me much. It had pictures pasted
under the varnish, some colored, some not.
There was a pair of scissors, a pen, a
needle-case, wafers,&mdash;all looking just as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
you could pick them up. What a nice
breakfast we had there! every thing tasted
so good on shore.</p>

<p>"Aunty," said Harry, "tell us what you
had for breakfast."</p>

<p>Let me see if I can remember. First we
had fish and eggs, with fried potatoes and
bananas. Then we had beefsteak, coffee,
tea, and iced claret, as it isn't safe to drink
the water there.</p>

<p>After breakfast, we sallied out to see the
sights. We walked across the public
square, down to the fortifications, and there
gathered some beautiful yellow flowers,
which I pressed. We saw plenty of natives
in their scant dresses. One little black fellow
I was particularly amused with. He had
on a little blue shirt, which his mother had
tied up in a knot in the middle of his back;
and there he was enjoying his mud pies,
and keeping his clothes clean too. We
walked down on the beach outside the city<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
walls; for Panama is a walled town. Here
we picked up shells on the sand. The little
crabs were very thick, and scampered away
from under our feet to their sandy holes, the
opening of which looked as round and even
as if made by a cane,&mdash;just such as I used to
make when I was a little girl, after a hard
rain, with the tip of my umbrella. As we
wandered over the rocks, for it was low
tide, we found an exquisite little natural
aquarium, all stocked with its tiny inhabitants.
It was a circular rock, with two
irregular terraces, and at its top a little
basin, deep here and shallow there; its
bottom was all covered with little spots of
pearly whiteness, looking as if inlaid. The
little shell-fish clung lovingly to its side;
the crabs, in their borrowed tenements,
crept securely about; and the funny little
fishes darted through the cool, clear waters.
Many a wealthy nobleman would like to
have that treasure of nature in his garden;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
yet perhaps no human eye had ever noted
its beauty before.</p>

<p>"Aunty, what do you mean by the borrowed
tenements of the crabs?" asked
Carrie.</p>

<p>There is one kind of crab that likes to
live in a shell; so if they find one empty,
they take possession of it; they are called
"hermit crabs." We often used to pick up
a shell with a crab in it.</p>

<p>At three o'clock we went to the cathedral,
which was open at that hour. The
front of it is rather imposing; but the doors
are roughly boarded up, and do not look as
well as our common barn-doors. We went
in at a side-door. There are many shrines
adorned with tinsel and cotton lace, but
neither beautiful nor pleasing. There was
a little girl, a child of one of our fellow-passengers,
in the cathedral; and knowing
that grandpa was a minister, she walked up
to him and said, "Do you preach here?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
The chief features of interest to me were
the pointed towers at either side of the
front, which are roofed with pearl shells.
Pearls of great beauty are found on various
parts of the coast, and there are stores
particularly devoted to the sale of them.
We visited the ruins of a Jesuit college,
also the old church of San Domingo. Some
of the arches in the latter are well preserved,
and are crested with beautiful shrubs
and vines in full bloom. The natives called
us "Americanos" as we passed. About
four, we took our places again in the omnibus,
and in a little while were at the wharf,
where we bought a supply of bananas,
oranges, and pineapples. Embarking again
on the little steam-tug, we enjoyed a pleasant
sail across the Bay of Panama, with the
city and its crumbling walls behind us.
In about half an hour we came in sight of
a large fleet of steamers; for it is here the
company keep their spare vessels. Among<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
them were the St. Louis, California,
Guatemala, and our own beautiful Constitution,&mdash;larger
and finer than any of the
others, with our old voyage companions
smiling their greetings over its side. It
seemed a long while since we had seen
them, and it was quite like getting home to
have them about us.</p>

<p>We lay at anchor all night, and the next
morning, Jan. 25, at six o'clock, our Pacific
voyage commenced. We passed in the
bay the mountainous island Toboga, with
a pretty little village lying snugly cradled
at its base. From this island's cool, clear,
springs, the drinking water of Panama, is
obtained.</p>

<p>"Don't they have wells in Panama?"
inquired Carrie.</p>

<p>Yes; but the water is brackish and
warm.</p>

<p>"What is 'brackish,' aunty?" said Alice.</p>

<p>Having a salt taste,&mdash;not pure. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
Constitution was very different from the
Ocean Queen, it being very clean and
sweet. When we went on board, the dinner-table
was set in the long saloon, and
every thing looked as in our best hotels.
We occupied a nice stateroom, having a
French bed with curtains, a sofa, a mirror
on the wall, and some very convenient
shelves. We had, also, good washing arrangements;
so that we were well settled
for a two weeks' voyage. There were three
waiters to each table, while there was but
one on the other steamer. The dessert was
prettily arranged, on tables at either end
of the saloon. All the orders were given
by a bell. The waiters went together to
the dessert-tables, and each took a dish of
pudding, or cake, or fruit and nuts, perhaps.
The bell struck, and they moved in
procession to their places, when at another
signal they placed the dishes upon the table.</p>

<p>Ah! there is <i>our</i> bell, and we must go.
Carrie, you may head the procession.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IV" id="IV"></a>IV.<br /><br />

From Panama to San Francisco.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">"A</span></span>UNTY, where are you?"
cried little Alice, and then
a gentle knock on my door
reminded me that it was
four o'clock. "We are all
ready waiting in the sitting-room,
and Fanny Mason is
there, too, because she
wants to hear our stories. You are willing;
an't you, aunty?"</p>

<p>Oh, yes, Alice, any of your friends may
come that wish. So I took my little pet's
hand, and went down to my waiting group
to tell my story.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We had beautiful summer weather, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
quite forgot that it was January. On the
29th we passed a distant volcano, and early
in the morning saw the smoke at its summit.
The name of the volcano is Colenso, and it
is in Guatemala. It was first seen in the
night, and our men sent up a rocket as a
signal, supposing it to be the light of another
steamer, but they soon saw their mistake.</p>

<p>The coast is mountainous all the way to
San Francisco; we kept it in sight nearly all
the time except when crossing the Gulfs of
Tehuantepec and California. The sea was
almost invariably smooth.</p>

<p>We arrived at Acapulco, in Mexico, Saturday,
Jan. 31, at daybreak; having sailed
1,440 miles in six days. As grandpa and
grandma were not going on shore, I had not
thought of doing so; but quite a party of
our acquaintance went, and I was invited to
join them. I was glad to go; for I longed
to step on Mexican soil.</p>

<p>We had a native boat and four rowers.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
The sail was a very pleasant one, and we
were soon on the low, sandy beach. Part
of the town was destroyed by an earthquake
two years ago; but the adobe houses are so
simply constructed that they can be rebuilt
with little difficulty.</p>

<p>"What are <i>adobe</i> houses?" asked Carrie.</p>

<p>Houses built of hardened clay. They
take a mold like the sides of a box with
the bottom out, and press it full of mud;
when turned out, it looks like a great mud
brick, and is left for the sun to dry.</p>

<p>We went up to the market-place, where
the Mexican women, children, and dogs were
all huddled together, with their wares spread
out in most tempting array; coral, colored
with most brilliant dyes; shells of various
kinds, some on long strings like necklaces,
and some single and highly polished. Fruits
were plenty,&mdash;bananas, granadas, oranges,
and limes. We had our chocolate and eggs
ordered; but just at that moment, boom!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
went our ship's cannon to recall us, so we
had to go back without our breakfast; but
we took some beautiful flowers and a few
shells. The forts had been bombarded by
the French about a month before, but looked
as if they were little injured. The harbor
is small, but one of the finest on the whole
Pacific coast. The native boys swam out
to the ship, and would dive for silver coin
thrown to them. It was astonishing to see
how far down in the water they would go
for it, and almost invariably get it. Then
they would put it in their mouths, and be
ready for another. One boy, the quickest of
the lot, must have had a dozen pieces in his
mouth at one time.</p>

<p>A shark and a devil-fish came near the
ship&mdash;</p>

<p>"A <i>devil-fish</i>!" the children all exclaimed;
"<i>why</i>, what sort of a fish is that?"</p>

<p>It is very large, having a pointed head
with projecting fins of great breadth, trian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>gular
and resembling wings, making the fish
broader than it is long, even including the
tail. The encyclopædia says one was
caught in the Atlantic, off Delaware Bay, in
1823, which was so heavy as to require three
pairs of oxen, a horse, and several men to
drag it ashore. It weighed about five tons,
and measured seventeen and a quarter feet
long, and eighteen feet broad; the skin was
blackish-brown, and underneath, black and
white; its mouth was two feet nine inches
wide, and the skull five feet. One was captured
in the harbor of Kingston on the
island of Jamaica, which had strength
enough to drag three or four boats fastened
together at the rate of four miles an hour.
The mouth of this one was four and a half
feet wide, and three feet deep, large enough
to contain the body of a man.</p>

<p>The day after we left Acapulco was the
Sabbath, and we had service in the saloon
in the morning, which made it seem quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
like a home Sabbath, and many were delighted
to have a "real Sunday." A table
was covered with an American flag; this was
the pulpit. The Bible was laid on it, and
grandpa preached. We sat around on the
saloon sofas. The captain could not attend,
as we were nearing the town of Manzanilla.
Just as the sermon was finished, we stopped
before that picturesque village. I believe
the town proper is inland. The few houses
on the shore looked very neat, being white-washed,
making a very pretty contrast with
the deep green of the lofty hills beyond.</p>

<p>After two hours' sail from Manzanilla, we
passed the wreck of the steamer Golden
Gate, which was burned some time since,
causing the loss of so many lives. Vessels
are stationed there to procure treasure from
the wreck, and we received from them more
than two hundred thousand dollars to carry
to San Francisco.</p>

<p>One of our officers was on the Golden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Gate when it was burned, and he told some
thrilling stories of the disaster. A great
many strong, grown people were drowned
in the terrible surf; yet one little baby, only
six weeks old, floated safely to the shore.
God took care of her, you see. The men
carried her by turns, as they walked their
weary way over the mountains to Manzanilla,
and fed her with scraped potato, a
barrel of potatoes having washed ashore.</p>

<p>How many sorrowful feelings were called
up by the sight of that one wheel lying on
the beach; for that is all that is left of the
ill-fated Golden Gate! How many lives
were lost in those peaceful waters over
which we were sailing so pleasantly! Our
officers told us that it was just such a bright,
beautiful day; but the surf here is very high,
and with our glass we could see it foaming
and tossing on the beach. In our hearts
many of us thanked God for our present
safety, and prayed him to save us from such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
a fate. Just before we neared the wreck,
we passed by some rocks on the coast, looking
just like a ruined castle, with beautiful
green trees all around them, as if it were a
nobleman's garden.</p>

<p>It is not easy to keep the Sabbath properly
on one of these ocean steamers; for little
distinction is observed in the days by the
crew. We did, however, the best we could.
It seemed more like the Sabbath in the
evening, when a goodly number of us collected
together in the saloon, and sung
hymns and tunes, just as many of us would
have done were we in our loved homes,
so far away. That night we commenced
crossing the Gulf of California, and all day
Monday we saw no land. Almost every
evening we walked upon the upper deck,
which was a very fine promenade three
hundred and seventy feet long.</p>

<p>Tuesday we saw Cape St. Lucas, which
you know is the end of the long peninsula<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
of California, and were in sight of the shore
all the way after that. I was constantly
surprised at the grandeur of this western
coast, with its magnificent chains of mountains,
rising peak above peak, and fleecy
clouds resting on their summits. There was
no break in these chains all the way to San
Francisco. I heard them called the backbone
of America, and they are among the
grandest works of the Creator. After passing
Cape St. Lucas, we had colder weather.</p>

<p>But I must not forget to tell you of my
going around the ship, with the commodore,
when he was "inspecting" it. Grandma
was not well enough to go, but grandpa and
I went. How I wish you could have peeped
with me into all the cupboards and utensils,
and have seen how neat every thing was,&mdash;the
dishes were so white, the glasses so
clear, and the tins so bright! The commodore
rubbed his fingers inside of a kettle,
and if they were the least bit soiled, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
would have to be done over again. On one
shelf was a great pile of loaves of bread.
We went into the slaughter-room, to see
the butcher's establishment; it was as
clean and sweet as a kitchen. The little
lamb, three days old, was brought out for
my amusement, and doubtless pleased its
mamma very much by showing off, and
saying "baa," like a dutiful child! What a
funny party we were, the portly commodore
with your small aunty leaning on his arm,
he sliding through narrow doors sideways,
pulling me after him; then tall grandpa,
and our little thin surgeon following in his
train! I asked the head steward to tell me
how much he cooked every day for all on
board. We had about five hundred passengers,
beside officers and crew. He told
me fifty gallons of soup, fifty pounds of
mutton, ninety pounds of pork, four hundred
and seventy-five pounds of beef, sixteen
pounds of ham, twenty-four chickens, ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
turkeys, eight hundred pounds of potatoes,
two barrels of flour, making two hundred
and twenty-five loaves of bread, fifty pies,
forty-five pounds of butter, five pounds
of lard, five pounds of cheese, and ten gallons
of milk. Just think what a great
boarding-house our steamer was!</p>

<p>On the 7th of February, we entered the
"Golden Gate" of California, and about
four o'clock were at the wharf at San
Francisco.</p>

<p>"The <i>Golden Gate</i>!" said wee Alice, in
astonishment, "They don't really have a
golden gate; do they?"</p>

<p>We all laughed at the little one's earnestness,
and then I told her it was only a narrow
entrance to San Francisco Bay, perhaps
a mile wide between the headlands.</p>

<p>"Well, what do they call it so for?" said
she.</p>

<p>I suppose because a great many who
went to California thought they would get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
a great deal of gold, and as they all went
through that narrow entrance, it was
called the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>"Supper, supper," here cried grandma.
"Don't you hear the bell?" and again it
sounded its merry summons to tea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="V" id="V"></a>V.<br /><br />

San Francisco.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">"A</span></span>UNTY," said Willie at my
elbow, "we are waiting
for you. You know we
arrived at San Francisco
yesterday, and we want to
hear about it now." So I
went down to my little flock
of listeners.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We stayed at the "Lick House" on
Montgomery Street,&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Lick House!</i>" cried Harry. "What a
funny name! What made them call it so?"</p>

<p>It was named for a Mr. Lick, who built
it. It is a very nice hotel, and we were
very glad to be again on land.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span></p>

<p>It took our friends but a short time to find
out we were there; for we received some
calls before we had our bonnets off, and
they continued to come until bedtime.
Beds!&mdash;how delightful to get into a real
bed again after being so long in berths; for
though, on the Constitution, grandpa and
grandma had a bed, I had my narrow
shelf.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath. We
attended Rev. Mr. Lacy's church in the
morning, and heard Rev. Mr. Bartlett of
Santa Cruz preach. In the afternoon, we
went out to the "Mission Dolores," to the
installation of Rev. Mr. Beckwith. We
were glad to arrive in California in time to
see him installed, and it was pleasant for
grandpa and Mr. Beckwith to meet again;
for the latter was once the President of
Oahu College in the Sandwich Islands.
All day Monday, friends came to see us, and
were so cordial and kind that it did our
hearts good.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon, thanks to a kind
friend, we went to ride. How delightful it
was to be in a carriage again, on a good
road, with fine horses, after our imprisonment
on board ship! Some of the streets
are paved with planks, some partially so;
others are very sandy, while some are hard
and smooth. We rode over the hills southwest
of San Francisco, where we got a fine
view of the city and parts of the bay. I had
expected to find San Francisco a level
place; but it is just the reverse; for it is
built on several very high hills. They have
been slashed and cut into unmercifully,
which greatly injures the looks of the older
part of the city. We had a fast trot on the
beach near the Ocean House. What a
surf! White-crested billows came roaring
and tumbling in, seeming as if ready to
ingulf us. We passed a poor shattered
fragment of a recent wreck, now almost
imbedded in the sand, and it made me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
shudder to think of being wrecked on that
cruel shore. It was a vessel but a little
smaller than the one we were to sail in;
and I sent up a silent petition to our heavenly
Father to save us from such a calamity.
Our good friend often stopped the carriage
to pick us wild-flowers, which were beginning
to fringe the roadside, and told us that
only a few weeks hence these hills would
be rainbow-hued with countless blossoms.
Roses grow here in the gardens all the year
round, and bouquets graced our table while
we remained. On our way back, we rode
through the "Mission Dolores," the seat of
an old Catholic mission, and stopped at the
church, an ancient looking adobe building,
with a tiled roof like the Panama houses.
We peeped in; then walked through the
burying-ground adjoining, where bloomed a
great variety of flowers, among them some
beautiful tea-roses. I wanted very much to
pick just one; but I saw a notice as I went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
in, asking us not to do so; and I thought if
every visitor plucked even one rose, there
would soon be none left. Late in the evening,
a beautiful bouquet was handed me, and
beside it was one fair, white, exquisite rosebud,
which my kind friend said he brought
me because I was so good at the burying-ground.
You see how much more enjoyment
I had over my beautiful flowers,
because I refrained from despoiling the
grave.</p>

<p>The next day, February 11, we bade
good-by to our friends, and went down to
the wharf. Some of our fellow-voyagers still
continued with us, going on to China, after
leaving us at the Sandwich Islands. We
went off in a boat to our clipper ship Archer,
and were hoisted over the vessel's side in a
chair, with the Union Jack wrapped round
us.</p>

<p>"What's the <i>Union Jack</i>?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>It is a blue flag with white stars. How<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
strange it seemed!&mdash;the little boat below
me, and the black ship's side near, while
I went up, up, up, swung over the rail, and
was let down on deck, landing in a group
of my fellow-passengers. That was the
way they all came. The wind blew hard,
and we dragged our anchor; so the vessel
"dropped down," as the sailors said, to the
lower part of the city, near Meig's wharf.
Here we remained two days, while a storm
raged outside the Golden Gate.</p>

<p>Friday, February 13th, we started again,
and just after the pilot left us, we were becalmed
on the bar, just opposite the terrible
breakers I had seen while riding. Here we
anchored. The sea was rough and disagreeable,
and our captain longed for a stiff
breeze to take us out; for it was not a very
safe place to be in. Early in the night, we
were glad to hear the chain-cable taken on
board, and to know that we were actually
on our voyage after so many delays.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aunty," said Carrie, "I have frequently
read of ships 'crossing the bar;' what does
it mean?"</p>

<p>There is often a place at the mouth of a
river, or at the entrance of a harbor or bay,
where the sand is washed up in a sort of
bank, making the water shallow just there,
so that large ships have to wait until high
tide, or when the water is deepest over those
sand-banks or bars, to come in.</p>

<p>There were seventeen passengers on board;
but we were not all of us on deck together for
six days, because the sea was so very rough
in consequence of the storm, by which we
had been detained in San Francisco Bay.
On the 19th of February, we got into the
trade-winds, which gave us a steady breeze
in the right direction, and for two days we
had twenty-eight sails set most of the time.
I longed to be where I could get a good
view of the ship with so many sails out; for
I thought she must look finely.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a Chinese steward on board&mdash;</p>

<p>"What does a <i>steward</i> do on a ship?"
interrupted Harry.</p>

<p>He takes charge of the table and provisions,
and often acts as cook. He had a hard
time in securing the dishes; for notwithstanding
the racks, the vessel rolled so that knives
and forks slipped off as if they had wings.
Racks are narrow strips, an inch or two
high, upon each edge of the table, and two
in the middle, with about a foot's distance
between them. These keep the dishes in
place when it is rough. It really did seem
as if the worst rolls came while we were at
meals; I suppose we noticed them more
then. Sometimes there was a general slide,
and the passengers would seize a tea-cup
with one hand, or a vegetable-dish, or a
chicken, while all held on by the table with
the other.</p>

<p>Thursday night, the 26th of February,
found us off a headland on the island of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
Oahu, and there we spent our first quiet
night since leaving San Francisco. There
was a buoy near us, marking the channel.
It looked like a square plank, and was
anchored with a bell upon it, which, as the
waves rolled it back and forth, tolled with
a mournful sound.</p>

<p>But there's a bell that doesn't sound
mournful. It says, "Come to tea!"</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VI" id="VI"></a>VI.<br /><br />

Honolulu.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE clock had hardly finished
striking four, when I heard
Harry coming up-stairs two
at a time, and "Hurra
for the Sandwich Islands!"
sounded at my door. So I
laid down my work, and was
soon in my usual seat.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">I had been told by some persons from
the islands that I must not expect to find
every where a green and tropical verdure; for
much of the country was barren, unfruitful
lava. I was up on deck bright and early, to
see this far-off part of the world. There
was "Diamond Head" before me, an extinct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
volcanic mountain, of a sort of reddish dust-color,
with its top fallen in, and without a tree
or spear of grass. Ah! I thought, with a sigh,
if all the islands are like this, it is well to
warn people not to expect too much. Soon
we moved our position, and sailed toward
the port of Honolulu. Then we neared the
land, and the pretty little village of Waikiki,
with its thatched cottages snugly reposing in
a tall cocoa-nut grove; then the green trees
of Honolulu, and the extinct crater of the
"Punchbowl," its summit fallen in too. But
a rent in its side showed us that it was bright
and green within, forming a huge meadow
with its ragged sides. All these opened
before us, in delightful contrast to the desolated
crater first seen.</p>

<p>We passed "Telegraph Hill," and soon, in
answer to a signal, our flags were hoisted,
and it was known in Honolulu, that the
clipper ship Archer, from San Francisco,
was outside with a mail; and in less than an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
hour the postmaster's boat was alongside.
Mr. Whitney, the editor of the "Pacific Advertiser,"
came, also, in his boat to get news
and papers. The captain gave the passengers
leave to go on shore, and stay till three
o'clock, and most of them by the courtesy
of Mr. Whitney went in his boat. But the
captain claimed two good missionary ladies,
who were on their way to Japan, and ourselves
as his party; so we waited until he
was ready; then we took our seats in
the chair, wrapped again in the Union
Jack, and were hoisted over into the boat.
Just as this pushed off, and we were looking
up to the vessel's side, over which were leaning
the smiling, kind-hearted sailors, the
captain called out, "Boys, can't you give
three cheers for the doctor?" Off came
every cap, and three rousing hurras filled the
air, bringing tears to our eyes, through
which we took our last look at the beautiful
ship Archer. Then we turned with curi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>osity
to see these islands, so new and strange.
I was in quite a puzzle to know how we
were going through the surf without upsetting
our boat, but there was a break in the
coral reef which afforded us a safe entrance.
On the wharf were a good many people
watching our approach, and we recognized
the familiar faces of some missionaries together
with those of our fellow-passengers
who had landed before us. Many a hearty
hand-grasp was given us as we jumped upon
the wharf, the passengers saying "Good-by,"
and our missionary friends giving their warm
welcomes to the islands.</p>

<p>After thanking our good captain for his
kindness to us, we rode to Rev. Mr. Clark's
where our home was to be for a time. We
were now actually at the end of our long
voyage; and we thanked our heavenly
Father for preserving us through dangers
seen and unseen. The house itself looked
hospitable,&mdash;a two-story white building, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
a double piazza, all covered by a vine resembling
the grape, its bunches of brown seeds
making the deception more complete. The
doors and windows were all open. I was
shown up to a quiet room with white curtains
and bed-draperies, from which an open door
led out upon the upper piazza and its green
festoons of vine. What a relief to eyes that
had so long gazed only on the boundless sea!</p>

<p>The missionaries had heard of the arrival
of grandpa and grandma, and soon we were
told there were callers below; so down we
went. What a scene! enough to repay us
for all our long journey. There were many
whom we had known at our own house, but
whom we never dreamed of seeing in their
missionary home. Heart met heart then;
some were so happy that they cried, and
tears were in our own eyes too. Thirty-seven
called that day, and we were very weary
when night dropped her curtain. Saturday
was the same,&mdash;callers all day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>The children of missionaries on these
islands have formed an association among
themselves which they call the "Cousin's
Society." There was to be a meeting of this
society on Saturday night at Oahu College,
Punahou; so we all went, starting about
dark. After driving up a winding carriage-road,
there burst suddenly upon us a fairy
scene. The principal building was low,
with trees and vines about it, and it seemed
one blaze of light. The rooms were decorated
with exquisite flowers and ferns, and
the young ladies and gentlemen were in
their gala dresses. Forty "Cousins" were
present that night. Grandpa made an address
to them, after President Mills had welcomed
us. They edit a paper in their
society called the "Maile Wreath." Maile
[My-le] is a beautiful vine that grows on the
islands, and is often used for wreaths. We
had some fine music that evening; for many
of the "Cousins" sing and play beautifully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
After we had been home awhile, about a
dozen of these, on their return, stopped and
serenaded us.</p>

<p>The next day was the Sabbath,&mdash;our first
Sabbath in what used to be a heathen land.
The church-bells rung just as sweetly as in
our beloved America, and the same stillness
reigned throughout the town. It was like a
home Sabbath. What a change in forty-three
years! We went to the mission-church
in the morning. It is a large stone
edifice of block coral, one hundred and forty-four
feet long and seventy-eight wide, and
was one of the first objects we saw after
passing Diamond Head. It was commenced
in 1838, and was five years in building, at a
cost of about thirty thousand dollars. Just
think of people, who, only twenty-five years
before, were in the depths of heathen darkness,
building such a church, and by voluntary
contributions too! They had a public
meeting, and the king subscribed three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
thousand dollars, and others gave their
pledges until the sum reached six thousand
dollars. We should think that doing very
well in one of our own enlightened Christian
assemblies. Notwithstanding their poverty,
they subscribed willingly. We, with all
our conveniences for building, can hardly
realize the labor bestowed on that church.
The timber had to be cut in the mountain
forests, and dragged by hand down to the
coast. The stone was dug out of the coral
reefs, and a quantity of coral had to be
gathered and burned for lime. All this the
people did willingly, and without pay, and
the carpenters and masons gave their work
freely. It was done unto the Lord.</p>

<p>In that church, which will doubtless stand
for ages, we met a large body of natives.
Grandpa made a speech to them which Rev.
Mr. Clark interpreted. The church was
very full. The natives are fond of bright
colors, and dress in red and yellow a great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
deal. The women's dresses are made just
like yoke night-gowns, falling to the feet
without being confined at the waist at all.
The men often wear their shirts outside of
their pantaloons like a sack, and sometimes
a coat is put on above that, making the effect
rather ludicrous. Bonnets the women wear
of all kinds, but principally small ones
of very old styles. These were perched on
the very top of the head, and were sometimes
trimmed with ribbons of five or six
colors. In the afternoon we went to church
again. The preacher was a blind native,
Pohaku, and he preached so easily, naming
the hymn and repeating it just as if he was
reading it, that one would never imagine he
was blind.</p>

<p>We shook hands with four or five hundred
natives that day, saying "aloha," which
means "love to you," "good-will," and is
their common salutation. They crowded
around us, and sometimes two would get<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
hold of my hand at once. A hand would
come over a shoulder, another under an
elbow, and round unheard-of corners, all
expressing joy and friendship.</p>

<p>But we must hear the rest of Honolulu
to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VII" id="VII"></a>VII.<br /><br />

Honolulu continued.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE first great event of the
week was a dinner-party at
Mr. Wyllie's, the minister of
foreign affairs. He is a
Scotchman, and wore his
official badges: a broad
blue band crossing his vest,
with the royal coat of arms
fastening it together on the hip just below
the waist of his dress-coat; also a star on
his breast, and two long streamers of crape
hanging from his left arm in memory of
the young Prince of Hawaii who died last
year.</p>

<p>At either end of the dining-hall hung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
three banners from a standard,&mdash;his Scottish
manorial flags, I presume; they gave a
showy look to the room. On the center of
the table was a magnificent standard of silver
with a lovely bouquet of flowers. When
the dessert was brought in, this was replaced
by a branching standard filled with fruit, more
elegant still. After the dessert, came a rich
and chaste drinking-bowl of silver lined
with gold, from which each was desired to
sip a little wine to the health of Lady
Franklin, who had once been his guest, and
who presented him the cup.</p>

<p>In the evening, about a dozen young
people took a moonlight walk up Punchbowl,
the extinct volcano just back of Honolulu.
It is apparently a round cone, about
five or six hundred feet high. The side we
ascended was steep, ragged, and rocky; but
the view of Honolulu from that elevation is
very fine. The taro patches were of a
deep green, the coral reefs in the harbor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
snowy white. The town with its thatched
houses lay quiet beneath us, while old Diamond
Head loomed up in solitary and barren
grandeur in the distance. We had some
fine singing from members of the party, and
the air was so clear and the night so still
that it was heard at a long distance.</p>

<p>"<i>Taro patches</i>, aunty? What are they?"</p>

<p>Taro is a vegetable somewhat resembling
the calla-lily, the roots of which are good
for food.</p>

<p>There are two kinds of it,&mdash;wet and dry.
The wet is grown under water. Square beds
are made, two or more feet deep, in which
the taro is planted; then the water is let in
at one end, and flows out of the other, thus
keeping running water upon the bed all the
time. It requires about a year for the plant
to get its growth. The natives bake the
root in their stone ovens, which are large
holes in the ground. They place at the
bottom of the oven a quantity of wood and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
over it a heap of stones, which are heated
thoroughly by the burning wood; then the
pig, chicken, potatoes, or whatever else they
wish to cook, are laid on the stones, leaves
being wrapped around them to keep them
clean, a little water is thrown on, and the
whole is covered with earth. The water
comes gradually in contact with the stones,
and is converted into steam, which, with the
heat of the stones, in a few hours cooks the
food.</p>

<p>After the taro is baked, they peel it with
a shell, and pound it with a stone pestle in
wooden trays, mixing with it water; then
they set it away to ferment. When ready
for use, it has a sort of lavender color, and is
acid. They call it <i>poi</i>; it tastes like yeast or
sour flour paste, and is eaten with coarse
salt. The natives eat with it raw fish.
This is the favorite Hawaiian dish.</p>

<p>"<i>Raw</i> fish, aunty?" said Carrie.</p>

<p>Yes, raw fish; they say raw fish tastes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
much better than cooked; but I could not
believe it. Yet we eat raw oysters; perhaps
that is no worse. Taro-tops are very good
greens. The natives usually sit round a
large calabash, and dip one, two, or three
fingers, according to the consistency of the
<i>poi</i>; then by a peculiar movement they take
it from the calabash, and convey it to the
mouth. That is their favorite mode of eating,
and they say it does not taste so well
when eaten with a spoon.</p>

<p>Next morning, some native women called
on us. There were about twenty of them.
They were cordial and kind, and their
"aloha" was very hearty as we shook
hands with each. Some were fine-looking,
tall and portly. A few could talk English
a little. They welcomed grandpa, making
a short speech in Hawaiian, and presented
us with some fowls, onions, cabbages, potatoes,
eggs, squashes, and taro. Grandpa
thanked them, and spoke of the interest he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and Christians in America had always felt in
them. Mr. Clark was interpreter, and their
faces lighted up with evident joy.</p>

<p>The following day we called on Prince
William Lunalilo, and his father Kanaina.
Prince William is one of the highest chiefs
in the kingdom, the rank here being determined
by the mother. In the reception-room
was a beautiful table, inlaid with specimens
of native woods. The furniture was
covered with red plush. On the walls were
oil paintings of the prince and his father and
mother, taken about fifteen years ago.</p>

<p>Prince William took us to the royal cemetery,
a small square stone building in the
spacious yard. In the center of the one
room on a table, was a crimson velvet cushion
trimmed with gold fringe, on which lay
the Hawaiian crown. Unfortunately, I did
not notice it particularly. On either side
were enormous coffins, that of Kamehameha
II. being the handsomest, and covered with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
a pall of green brocaded silk; others were
covered also with silk palls, or draped in
black. Some of the coffins were long and
large, the high chiefs having been, as a general
thing, tall and stout. One could not
help thinking that here was the end of
earthly grandeur; the monarch and his lowest
subject must alike die.</p>

<p>We went to a prayer-meeting at Oahu
College, Punahou, on Wednesday night. It
was a pleasant thing to meet with twenty or
thirty missionary children for prayer and
praise.</p>

<p>Thursday morning we listened to some
very creditable recitations, and examined
some beautiful drawings by the young ladies
and gentlemen, and after lunch heard compositions,
and saw the ladies practice calisthenics;
all of which would have done
honor to one of our home institutions. In
the afternoon, we drove back to Honolulu,
and attended a sewing-circle at the house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
of one of the foreign residents. It really
seemed like one of our home circles, the
profusion of exquisite flowers and the absence
of our cold March weather only dispelling
the illusion. We reveled in the
lovely roses, our green-house favorites
blooming here with such rank luxuriance.
I saw here for the first time in my life a
<i>green</i> rose.</p>

<p>"Green rose?" asked little Alice. "I
never heard of such a thing."</p>

<p>Yes, a veritable green rose of just the
same shape as the common rose, only a deep
genuine green. It had a very odd look.
Many of our green-house plants grow to be
extremely large here, as there is no chilling
wind or snow to nip their growth.</p>

<p>That night our first letters came, two
months after we left home. What joy to
hear from the dear ones, even though the
letters were written only a fortnight after our
departure. It takes six weeks for letters to
go from New York to Honolulu.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>Friday morning, her majesty the queen
gave us a private reception; the king was
out of town. We were notified, the day
before, that the queen would be pleased to
see us informally, and would send her carriage
for us. So at eleven o'clock a barouche
was before the door, drawn by a span of
dark horses. A coachman and footman in a
livery of green and gold completed the establishment.
When we arrived at the palace
gates, the guard opened them wide for us,
and we passed on to the rear of the palace
where was the queen's own suite of rooms.
On the steps we were met by the minister
of foreign affairs, who escorted us to a
reception-room, and a few minutes later to
the drawing-room. There we were met by
the queen in a ladylike manner, she taking
our hand, and expressing pleasure at meeting
us. She was in deep mourning for the
prince, her only son, who died last year.
Her dress was black, trimmed half-way up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the skirt with a heavy fold of crape, headed
by a box-plaiting of the same. We here
met the Princess Victoria, a sister of the
king. The queen gave to each of us a lithograph
likeness of the late King Kamehameha
III. The chancellor of the kingdom,
Chief Justice Allen and his lady were
present. We returned home in the queen's
carriage.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we had a very pleasant
dinner-party at the chief justice's. In the
evening, I accepted an invitation to ride with
a large party of young people, all on horseback;
there were seventeen couples, composed
entirely of foreigners, more than half
of whom belonged to mission families. You
would be amused to see the native women
ride like the men, with a strip of bright
calico wound round their waist and limbs,
falling off like a skirt on each side; the
color is usually red, or red and yellow, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
they look decidedly gay, sitting so erect in
the saddle, and riding at full gallop.</p>

<p>On Sabbath morning we attended at Mr.
Smith's church, a large square hall, with a
thatched roof. We sat in a wealthy native
lady's pew. It was painted a brilliant scarlet,
and the cushion was covered with a
striped magenta-and-yellow calico. The
one in front of us was painted an intense
green. Grandpa made an address during
service, and afterward, to the children of the
Sabbath-school. Every seat was full, and
the people very attentive. There was an
old native man, with only one arm, who acted
the part of sexton, and sometimes waked
people up. I fancy there would be fewer
sleepers in American churches, if there was
anybody to perform a similar office. We
shook hands with a great many natives after
service. They are very fond of this ceremony,
and we were glad to give them that
expression of our good-will. Three of them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
as they shook hands, left a quarter of a dollar
each in mine. I could not return them,
for that would give offense, and as I was
unwilling to keep them, I put them into the
missionary-box.</p>

<p>To-morrow we will leave Honolulu.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="VIII" id="VIII"></a>VIII.<br /><br />

From Honolulu to Hilo.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapc"><span class="dropcap">"C</span></span>OME, aunty," said Willie,
"we are all ready for our
journey." So I began.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We rode down to the
steamer Kilauea about four
o'clock Monday afternoon.
A great crowd was on the
wharf; among them many of our good
friends to see us off. Indeed, we could
not feel that we were strangers in a strange
land. The sight of the steamer was a
novel one; the deck was covered with men,
women, children, and dogs, with mats, calabashes,
etc. It is quite a fashion here to
trim the hair with flowers, and to wear them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
strung about the neck. Many of these
people were so decorated, and it made quite
a lively scene, with their gay calico dresses.
The women generally have their hair divided
into two long braids behind; these they
bring up on the top of the head with a round
comb, and slip the flowers in about the
comb.</p>

<p>The queen and her suite came on board
last. She was going to join the king at
their country-seat at Kailua, on Hawaii. A
salute of twenty-one guns was fired by Her
Majesty's guard, who then formed in a line
on the wharf and gave three cheers. The
royal company preferred to sleep on deck,
so that nearly all who occupied the saloon
were foreigners.</p>

<p>To us Americans, it seemed a strange
thing to have both gentlemen and ladies
occupy the same saloon at night, and it was
rather embarrassing to mount into an upper
berth with half a dozen gentlemen looking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
on. But we soon became accustomed to it,
and learned not to be alarmed at finding a
Chinaman asleep on the transom below.</p>

<p>"What is a <i>transom</i>, aunty?" asked
Harry.</p>

<p>A sort of cushioned bench, running along
both sides of the saloon just outside the
under berths.</p>

<p>At half-past four in the morning, we
reached Lahaina, Maui. The steamer
stopped here some hours; so Dr. Baldwin
came off for us, and took us to his house to
breakfast. Many friends, new and old,
called, and some beautiful flowers were sent
from Lahainaluna, about two miles distant,
where there is a seminary for native young
men. After breakfast, a large company of
natives escorted us to the shore, carrying
our shawls and bags, seeming eager to do
something for our comfort. I wanted to
take a photograph of grandpa, as he stood
surrounded by natives, he looked so much
the picture of happy contentment.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>On the steamer we tried our first cocoa-nuts.
They are very different from those
we get at home, the meat not being half so
thick, and quite soft. There is more than
as much again liquid, and it is sweeter, and
colorless like water.</p>

<p>A few hours' sail brought us to Kalepolepo.
Rev. Mr. Alexander had ridden over
from Wailuku, ten miles distant, and came
on board, and stayed with us some hours
while the steamer took on board a supply of
wood. It was good to see his beaming face,
and receive his cordial welcome. He gave
me a lesson in Hawaiian.</p>

<p>"What was it, aunty?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>One sentence was, "He olu olu anei
oe?" Are you well? You would say perhaps,
"Aole au i ike." I don't understand.</p>

<p>"How funny!" said little Alice.</p>

<p>The next morning, just before we reached
Kailua, we discovered the king's barge, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
in a few minutes he himself came on board
with some of his attendants. The meeting
between himself and his queen was affecting;
she, not having been to their country-seat
since the death of the young prince, was
quite overcome. His Majesty was dressed
in a light mixed suit, with drab buskins
buttoned to the knee, white boots, and a
drab felt hat, with about two inches of crape
on it. His buskins, setting off his fine form,
gave him a very noble appearance. Indeed,
he seemed to feel himself every inch a king.
After the queen had become somewhat composed,
he came to where we sat and, with a
hearty shake of the hand, welcomed us to his
country. He spoke of his visit to America,
some years ago, and conversed very agreeably
for some little time. At leaving us, both he
and the queen again shook hands, with the
same pleasant manner.</p>

<p>At noon we arrived in Kealakekua Bay,
on the west side of Hawaii, where Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
Cook was killed. Rev. Mr. Paris was on
the beach, with horses to take us to his
house, about two miles distant. As the
steamer was to remain till night, we went.
Our landing was almost on the very spot
where Cook was killed. Grandma and I
donned our riding-skirts, mounted our horses
and started on our ride. Such hills and
roads, so dusty and steep, never before
entered my imagination! It was the first
time grandma had been on a horse for forty
years. Sometimes we were a little afraid;
but as our horses were not, we gathered
courage. At times a precipice rose above
us three or four hundred feet on one side,
and on the other descended perhaps a hundred
feet. The rock was of lava, much
broken, sometimes looking like the waves
of the sea, or like a stream rolling over the
precipice. A portion of the road was cut
out of the side of the rock. Mrs. Paris's
cordial greeting repaid us for our hot and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
dusty ride. Here, for the first time, I saw
orange-trees in full bloom. They were large
and elegant trees, with blossoms and green
and ripe fruit growing at the same time.
How we enjoyed the fruit, luscious and
juicy, and so refreshing after our ride! The
arbutulum grows here like a large tree, and
blossoms profusely. In the garden we saw
young pine-apples, green mangoes, and
Chinese oranges,&mdash;a perfect orange in
miniature, but acid as a lemon.</p>

<p>Toward sunset, we returned to the ship.
Darkness covered us before reaching the
shore; but our sure-footed horses took us
down without a mishap. At the head of the
bay rises a pali, or precipice, six or seven
hundred feet high, and it is said to go down
perpendicularly into the water perhaps as
much more.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Valley of Waipio</span>.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>On Thursday, we sailed all day along
grand precipices rising from the ocean,
some of them seven hundred or a thousand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
feet high, with waterfalls leaping the whole
distance, or broken into smaller cascades.
Sometimes the streams seemed like a silver
ribbon, bordered with green moss; these
steeps being generally covered with verdure.
Here and there was a deep gorge or gulch,
as they are there called. The first and only
valley of importance we saw was Waipio,
whose sides rose exceedingly grand and
beautiful, with zigzag mule-paths up the
slopes. Far in the distance, amid its shadows,
fell a ribbon-like cascade, said to be
two thousand four hundred feet high; behind
it lay mountains with their summits
resting in the clouds. A village with its
pretty church nestled in a grove of cocoa-nuts
on the beach. After this the precipices
grew lower and lower, until finally the scene
changed to undulating hills, and a rain
storm notified us that we were approaching
Hilo. We reached that place about ten
o'clock at night, and landed through the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
surf; that is, the little boat stopped about
fifty feet from the shore, and a man waded
out and took grandma in his arms; but
there being a little delay in getting ashore,
the wave rolled in upon her and gave her
quite a wetting. When the man came back,
and said, "Come, come," I started immediately.
The surf roared in the darkness, and
I was afraid, but was very soon set down
safely on the shore. Dr. Wetmore met us
on the beach, and escorted us in the rain to
Mrs. Coan's house. Mr. Coan was away
upon a tour; but they sent a messenger after
him, and he returned home on Saturday.</p>

<p>Hilo is celebrated for its heavy rains, and
I should think also for its gigantic spiders.
I was afraid of them, though it is said they
are harmless unless molested.</p>

<p>Sabbath we passed in the usual manner.
Grandpa addressed the native congregation
in the morning, and told them of his visit to
the Holy Land. They seemed delighted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
see one who had looked upon Jerusalem,
and walked by the shores of Gennesaret.</p>

<p>There is the supper-bell; so we must wait
until to-morrow for another story.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="IX" id="IX"></a>IX.<br /><br />

The Volcano.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapn"><span class="dropcap">"N</span></span>OW, aunty, what are we to
see to-day, and where are
we to go?" asked Willie, as
we assembled in the sitting-room.</p>

<p>We'll go to the volcano
to-day, Willie, I answered.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Tuesday morning, we started on our first
real horseback journey. The party numbered
seven,&mdash;three elderly people and
four younger ones. Two of our friends
escorted us a few miles on our way, and
then, as it began to rain, they turned back.
I could think of nothing but a party of gipsies,
as we rode out of Mr. Coan's yard.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
You would have laughed to see our fitting
out. Grandpa had on rubber overalls, a
long rubber coat, and a drab felt hat tied
upon his head. I doubt if you would have
known him. Grandma wore a dark riding-skirt,
an oil-cloth cape over her shoulders,
and a felt hat, decidedly slouchy, trimmed
with green ribbon. I had on an old drab
skirt, my water-proof cloak, and a venerable
straw hat trimmed with green, with a blue
barege veil falling from its brim. The rest
were dressed in similar style. We rode in single
file, and the road was so bad, if road it
could be called, that we advanced barely
two miles an hour. Every few minutes we
had to go up or down some steep place,
or through mud nearly a foot deep. Swamps
and streams alternated with our short hills.
At length we came to a wood of tropical
luxuriance, where the road was just a mule-path,
the branches often meeting before our
faces, so that we had to raise our hands to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
part them. It rained as it always does
here. While we young people were venturing
on a short canter, my saddle turned
completely, and I landed on my feet in an
oozy place, fortunately unhurt. A few miles
short of the half-way house,&mdash;miles are not
measured by feelings there,&mdash;my horse gave
out. For some time he had walked lame in
all his feet, and at last refused to go at all.
One of the young gentlemen lent me his
horse, and led mine. We reached the half-way
house about five o'clock, wet through.
This was a native house, the occupants of
which at once turned out, bag and baggage,
the latter consisting, however, of only a few
calabashes and pillows, and removed into a
smaller hut. We found our house neatly
laid with mats, and looking comparatively
inviting. The firebrands had been carried
out, leaving only the coals in the center of
the floor, surrounded by stones to protect
the matting. The house was of thatched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
sides and altogether looked very much like
the native houses we saw on the Isthmus.</p>

<p>We made a temporary curtain of a blanket,
put on dry clothes, hanging our wet
ones up to dry; then laid a table-cloth on
the matting, and from buckets and calabashes
brought out our dinner. Our service
was of tin; but we made a hearty meal,
sitting Turk fashion on the mat. After our
dinner and tea together, the natives came
in, and we had prayers. Mr. Coan read a
few verses in English and then in the native
language, which was followed by two
prayers, one in English, the other in Hawaiian,
by the head of the family. We
then lay down to sleep; but cockroaches,
fleas, and a strong cup of tea drove slumber
from our eyelids, and there was more sighing
than sleep. The men who brought our
calabashes walked or dog-trotted it all the
way barefooted, and got on faster than we
did. The calabashes are fastened one at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
each end of a pole four or five feet long, and
the bearers don't seem to mind the weight,
balancing them easily on their shoulders and
carrying them safely. We never missed the
smallest article, and nothing was injured by
jarring.</p>

<p>We mounted our horses the next morning
with good courage, though it was dubious
weather, and we had a long ride before us.
After a while, we young folks headed the
procession and cantered when we could,
which was seldom, as a great deal of the way
was like riding in the bed of a brook. It
had rained so much that a puddle of water
was met every few feet. Part of our way
was through a beautiful growth of gigantic
ferns, mingled with other trees. The ferns
were of a beautiful species, growing twenty
or more feet high, and crowned with waving
feathery branches. Other trees had their
bark almost hidden by velvety moss or tiny
ferns.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>We arrived at the volcano house wet and
tired, about three o'clock, but were much
comforted by the cleanly appearance of the
house, so nicely matted were the floors, with
a raised place for sleeping. Outside, under
a roof like a veranda, was a blazing fire, and
it was needed for drying our clothes, and
sending warmth through our chilled limbs.</p>

<p>We ladies retired behind our curtain, and
soon appeared in complete Bloomer costume.
We set our table in more civilized
style, having a rough board whereon to
lay our cloth, while benches saved the
necessity of our sitting again in Turk
fashion. We rested better than the previous
night, rousing ourselves once in a
while from our lowly matted couch to gaze
through the mist at the light from the crater,
which looked like an enormous fire.</p>

<p>About nine the next morning, we took
our winding way to the edge of the bluff,
commanding a fine view of the crater; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
there it lay before us, a huge, blackened,
fire-desolated gulf! Steam issued from fissures
in various parts, while a dense rolling
volume marked the place of the really burning
lake: We ladies, in our Bloomer dresses,&mdash;for
it isn't safe to wear long skirts,&mdash;started
down the precipice. At some of the
steep places, our gentlemen tied ropes to the
shrubs, and, with jumping and careful walking,
we were soon down upon the lava
floor.</p>

<p>"How did it feel to walk on the lava,
aunty?" said Willie.</p>

<p>It seemed like walking on a snow-crust.
Once in a while a foot would sink through,
and this at first alarmed us; but we soon
got used to it. There were many deep fissures
in the lava, from some of which issued
steam; these we used to jump over.</p>

<p>"How wide were they?" asked Harry.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image092.png" width="600" height="368" alt="The Volcano of Kilauea.&mdash;Page 92." title="The Volcano of Kilauea.&mdash;Page 92." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">The Volcano of Kilauea</span>.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>One or two feet wide; and no one knows
how deep. Mr. Coan seemed to think that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
forty feet below us might be liquid lava.
The lava had flowed in countless shapes and
ways. Sometimes it had hardened in circles,
or parts of a circle, or it was all crumbled
and broken. This last they call a-a [ah-ah].
Often a piece of the thin crust cracked
under our footsteps, and turning it over, there
would be upon the under surface all the
colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p>After a walk of two and a half miles, we
came to what is called the "blow hole,"
where steam rushes out with great force
and a loud report, like many factory pipes.
It seemed as if some angry goddess dwelt
below, whom we had insulted by coming
into her domains, and that she was belching
out her fierce anger, and vowing vengeance.</p>

<p>But the final wonder was when the fiery
gulf came into view. It must have been
half a mile square, and was about fifty feet
below the level of where we stood. It was
boiling up all over its lead-colored surface.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
Toward the center, it would blacken over,
and the blacker it grew, the more intently
we watched, until finally it rose in a huge
dome thousands of tons in weight, red and
fiery, and fell as suddenly. It was so hot,
that we had to cover our faces or turn away.
There were several red-hot fountains in
various parts of the lake, throwing up jets
of lava. One was near a shallow cave, from
the edges of which, the lava hung in beautiful
flame-colored stalactites.</p>

<p>"What are <i>stalactites</i>?" asked little
Alice.</p>

<p>An icicle is a stalactite of frozen water;
these were of lava, shaped just like large
icicles.</p>

<p>All the while, the lake was boiling up in
some places, and wrinkling and folding over
at the edges. It was a terrible and exciting
sight. One of the party would shout,
"There, there, the boiler is going to throw
up now!" and as it rose into the air, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
grand chorus of "<i>There!</i>" would announce
the end of that discharge. It is impossible
to describe to you the grandeur of the
scene. It is one of God's most wonderful
works. We felt weak and powerless before
it.</p>

<p>We took our lunch on the shore of this
fiery lake, and afterwards spent an hour in
gathering specimens of the different kinds
of lava.</p>

<p>Not far from the lake is a peak of lava
which is called the "Gothic Cathedral" from
its shape. Some of the party passed by a
block looking like a lion. There were huge
fields of "a-a" where the lava was thrown
up into rough heaps, as if some one had
tried to knead up blocks a foot square, and
given it up as a bad job. We walked nearly
six miles in the crater, going and coming,
which will give you an idea of its size. It
is nine miles in circumference. Our young
gentlemen we left behind, as they had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
discovered a new cave where they could
see many valuable specimens. When we
reached the house, we were wet and tired;
for it rained while we were in the crater,
and we had to change our clothes. We
ladies saw the yellow sulphur beds in the
distance, but were too weary to visit them.</p>

<p>During our absence, the native men had
gathered a quantity of ohelo berries, resembling
cranberries, but tasting like blueberries,
not so sweet perhaps, but like them seedless;
they were very nice with sugar, so we
added them to our bill of fare. Remind me
of those berries to-morrow, and I'll tell you
a story about them.</p>

<p>Now for supper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="X" id="X"></a>X.<br /><br />

A Story about Kapiolani.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>S I entered the sitting-room,
I was greeted by a chorus
of voices saying, "Aunty,
the berries, you know!"
So I began.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">A good while ago, when
the missionaries first went
to the Hawaiian Islands, a princess lived
there named Kapiolani, the daughter of
Keawemauhili. She was a portly person,
as most in high rank were, having
an engaging countenance, a keen black
eye, and black hair put up by a comb.
She dressed in a civilized fashion, and used
chairs and tables. Her husband's name was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
Naihe. In the year 1825, only five years
after the mission was commenced, Kapiolani
was living at Kaawaloa. Many of her
countrymen still supposed that the volcano
was the abode of a powerful goddess, whose
name was Pele. They were very superstitious,
and reverenced and feared to anger
this goddess.</p>

<p>Kapiolani had become a Christian, and
felt sorry for her poor people who were still
in the darkness of paganism, and determined
to break the spell that bound them. So she
announced her intention to visit the crater
of Kilauea, and call upon the goddess to do
her worst. Her husband and many others
endeavored to dissuade her, but she was
not to be moved from her purpose. She
traveled, mostly on foot, over a rough and
desolate road, a distance of about a hundred
miles.</p>

<p>As she drew near the volcano, she was
met by one who claimed to be a prophetess<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
of Pele, and threatened her with the displeasure
of the goddess, should she come
into her domains on this hostile errand.
She was told that she would certainly perish
if she went to the crater. Kapiolani disregarded
the impostor, and went on. Those
ohelo berries which I spoke of in my last
story were sacred to Pele, and no one dared
to eat them unless they had first offered some
to the goddess. But Kapiolani gathered
and ate them. "She and her company of
about eighty," said Mr. Bingham, "accompanied
by a missionary, descended from the
rim of the crater to the black ledge. There,
in full view of the terrific panorama before
them, she threw in the berries, and calmly
addressed the company thus: 'Jehovah is
my God. He kindled these fires. I fear
not Pele. If I perish by the anger of Pele,
then you may fear the power of Pele; but
if I trust in Jehovah, and he shall save me
from the wrath of Pele when I break through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
her tabus, then you must fear and serve the
Lord Jehovah. All the gods of Hawaii are
vain. Great is the goodness of Jehovah in
sending missionaries to turn us from these
vanities to the living God and the way of
righteousness!'" Then amid the horrid
belching and bellowing of the crater, they
sung a hymn of praise, and prayed to the
God of heaven and earth.</p>

<p>Now wasn't it a grand, a noble thing for
this woman, who had been educated in the
grossest idolatry, who had only heard of the
true God within a very few years, thus to
come out and defy her nation's deity, this
Pele? Why, even we, brought up in the
light and power of the gospel, could not
wonder that those benighted savages feared
and worshiped. We silently thanked God
in our hearts, that we knew him as our
Creator and the Maker of this wonderful
volcano, instead of a wicked, revengeful
heathen god.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"You spoke of Pele's <i>tabus</i>; what is a
tabu, aunty?" said Carrie.</p>

<p>Anything forbidden by their law or customs
was called "tabu."</p>

<p>Now we will go back to our journey.
The day after we descended the crater, we
started for the half-way house on our return.
It was a dreary, rainy morning, but cleared
up soon, though no sun was visible. The
roads were dryer, and we young people cantered
off, leaving the more staid portion of
the party behind; and reached our resting-place
two hours or more before the others,
and before our native men too. We were
hungry, but our calabashes of food were far
behind us, so we fell to decorating the house,
in order to occupy our time. It was a simple
thatched hut, with no windows and only
one door. We built an arch over the doorway
of two gigantic ferns, with a bouquet of
red roses in the center, and made thence a
continuous wreath of ferns and red leaves to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
the end of the house, and down to the
ground each side. The bright red leaves
were brought us by the little kanaka [native]
children. Inside, opposite the door, we made
another arch, and twined a wreath around
the center pole supporting the roof. Our
native men, as they entered, exclaimed
"nani," handsome, or "maikai," good. And
Mr. Coan's face, as he came up the hill,
smiled approval. It really had entirely
transformed the dingy hut into quite a fairy
bower. All night, fleas and cockroaches
disputed with us for its possession, and we
rose in the morning, unrefreshed, to a day's
ride in the rain. The road was worse than
on the day we first came over it. It had
stormed incessantly, the streams were swollen,
the mud was deeper, and our horses
stiff and weary, not to mention ourselves as
in the same predicament. At times it rained
so hard that our horses turned their backs to
it, and refused to move, and there we had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
sit until the violence of the shower was over.
We often waded through streams up to the
saddle-girth. Part of the way, the road was
made of the trunks of fern-trees laid crosswise,
not more than two or three feet broad.
They were worn and broken, and in some
places decayed entirely away. We considered
it, however, a good road, and cantered
over it, our sure-footed horses never once
stumbling. Glad indeed, were we, to see
the white spire of the Hilo church, and more
glad to reach Mr. Coan's hospitable house,
where hot baths and a good dinner in some
degree enlivened us. Grandma was tired,
but a night and day's rest made her quite
herself again. We felt amply repaid for
any amount of fatigue or discomfort, by our
view of the crater and burning lake. It was
a scene for a lifetime; no pen could describe
it, no pencil portray it; one must see it
with one's own eyes, to appreciate its wonders.
God alone could create it; and his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
power only could say to this surging, fiery
torrent, "Thus far shalt thou come, and no
farther."</p>

<p>March 24th, we took the steamer Kilauea.
It rained as we sailed out of the bay,&mdash;Byron's
Bay as it is called. The surf rolls in
here terrifically, and beats upon the shore
with an incessant booming sound. The
view of Hilo, as you enter the bay, is said to
be very fine; but we were so unfortunate as
to come in, in the night, and to go out in a
rain-storm. The natives play in the surf a
great deal. They have what is called a surfboard
perhaps four or five feet long. With
this board, they swim out perhaps a mile,
and then lying on it, ride in on the top of
the surf-billows. I was sorry not to see this
amusement; but the little children, with
their small boards, I often saw trying to
imitate their elders.</p>

<p>"Don't they ever get hurt, aunty?" asked
little Alice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span></p>

<p>Not often. The natives are perfectly
at home in the water, and can swim long
distances. The women are about as good
swimmers as the men.</p>

<p>Ah, the bell! the bell! we mustn't keep
grandpa waiting.</p>

Kau and Journey to Kaawaloa.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span>T half-past six in the morning,
we landed in Kau,&mdash;that
is grandpa and I did;
grandma went on in the
steamer to Kealakekua Bay.
Rev. Mr. Gulick met us
as we stepped on shore.
Horses were in waiting, and
we were soon in the saddle ready for our
seven miles' ride to Waiohinu. Mr. and
Mrs. Gulick have here a boarding-school for
native girls. They had nine pupils of various
shades and sizes. Some of them seemed
very bright and intelligent, and were quick
and handy about their work. Beside their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
studies, they are beginning to learn to make
their own clothes and to do housework.</p>

<p>Sabbath morning we visited the Sabbath-school.
As we entered, the children were
singing in Hawaiian the hymn, "I want to
be an Angel," and soon after "I have a
Father in the Promised Land," both of them
to the familiar tunes the children sing with
us. It quite carried me back in association
to our home Sabbath-schools. The Hawaiians
love to sing, and the children sing
with all their hearts, just as our children
do.</p>

<p>Grandpa gave them a short talk, and then
we went into the church, and he addressed
the native congregation,&mdash;an intelligent and
well-dressed body of men and women. The
Hawaiians as a race are excessively fond of
flowers. Some of the girls wore wreaths of
rosebuds round their necks; some had
flowers in their hair, and others held a few
in their hands. The judge of the district,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
who had a little daughter in Mr. Gulick's
school, brought her a wand of roses,
wreathed round a stick, which he handed
to her with a smile as she came into church.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, grandpa preached to
the foreign residents. Every white person
but one in the district was present, making
sixteen in all including ourselves. There
were only four ladies, most of the men
having native wives. The shoemaker, the
blacksmith, the missionary, the planter, all
met in that little parlor, to hear a sermon in
their native tongue. It made no difference
what was their religious belief; they came
dressed in their best, and some of them
joined in singing the hymns, the tunes
doubtless familiar to them long ago, before
they left their father's roof.</p>

<p>Monday morning we started on our journey
across the island, to where grandma
was staying. Our baggage was packed on
a mule, and the saddle-bags filled with our
eatables.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are <i>saddle-bags</i>?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>They are two bags fastened on a broad
strip of leather, made to fit on the back part
of a saddle, so arranged that a bag will
hang on each side of the horse, the two
thus balancing each other.</p>

<p>Mr. Gulick accompanied us, and quite a
number of natives traveled a part of the
way. We started in a rain; six or seven
miles of the road were good; the rest was
bad enough to make up for it. The first
half-day we passed over that kind of lava
called "a-a," the whole tract, as far as the
eye could reach, looking as if a mountain of
lava had been thrown thousands of feet in
the air, and fallen, crumbled and broken, into
irregular ridges and heaps, blackened and
barren. In riding, we passed over an apology
for a road, reminding me of our American
roads when filled in with broken stone
before being covered with the gravel. Some
of the ridges were fearfully steep and jagged.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
Here it seemed as if&mdash;as a friend remarked&mdash;"we
were out of sight of land." Hardly
a bush or tree was to be seen. I never
knew the meaning of desolation before.
We grew weary of the dull black scene, and
it rained and rained, but we kept on, up one
steep place and down another. The last
part of our day's ride was through woods,
over hard lava, which they call "pahoihoi;"
but it was along a mountain side, and the
same steep ridges followed us. Darkness
came just as we neared the native village
where we were to spend the night. We
had passed over a hard road of thirty-five
miles, and been ten hours in the saddle.
We were, of course, not sorry to dismount,
which we did at the largest native house.
The man of the house was down at the
sea-shore; the family were of course not
expecting foreigners. In the center of the
house was a fire of glowing coals, and near
it sat an old woman stringing candle-nuts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
upon a cocoa-nut fiber, which were their only
lamps.</p>

<p>"What are <i>candle-nuts</i>?" asked the children.</p>

<p>They grow on a beautiful tree called
"kukui," or candle-nut tree. The nuts are
about the size of a walnut, and are so oily
as to burn quite well.</p>

<p>Some one went over to the church, a simple
thatched house like the rest, and brought
us the only two chairs the village possessed.
We set out our simple meal on the mat, and
by twos and threes the natives dropped in to
see us, bringing children and babies; so that
by the time our supper was over, almost all
the village were present to see the "houris"
or foreigners. After we had finished, we
had family worship, Mr. Gulick acting as
interpreter. Then Mr. G. asked where we
were to sleep. Our landlord and his wife
had one corner of the room, another man
and his wife another corner, our native men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
a third, and we the fourth. Learning that
our shawls were wet, the son brought out a
large bed tapa for our covering. Taking
our bags for pillows, we lay down to rest,&mdash;<i>sleep</i>,
I can not say, for fleas and cockroaches
were too abundant to permit this.</p>

<p>"What is <i>tapa</i>, aunty?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>Tapa is their native cloth made from the
bark of trees. They take the inner part of
the bark, I believe, and beat it with mallets
of very hard wood until it is soft and flexible,
wetting the bark from time to time. It
looks like a kind of paper, rather than cloth.
These cloths the natives dye with various
colors, in patterns to suit their own fancy.
The bed tapas are from three to five large
sheets placed one above another, and are
very warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>Early next morning, we started on our
journey through field and forest, and reached
Mr. Paris's house about half-past two, having
accomplished our journey of sixty miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
in eighteen hours. We were cordially welcomed
by the family, and were glad indeed
to be with grandma again.</p>

<p>We walked one evening to the house
near by, where Kapiolani and her husband
Naihe lived. You remember Kapiolani
was the brave princess I told you of. It
was a stone house, built of solid coral rocks,
the walls three feet thick, and is on an eminence
commanding a fine view of the sea.
No one was now living in the house; but
quite a number of little kittens, wild as they
could be, scampered in terror from room to
room, as we went through the apartments.</p>

<p>Next morning, Mr. Paris took us out to
ride. We visited a native church about two
miles from his house, a pretty stone building,
nicely finished off inside with koa wood,
much resembling mahogany. The horse
grandpa rode was a handsome black fellow;
mine was a large sorrel called Bonaparte.
Both horses had a decided aversion to going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
through puddles of water. Bonaparte had
been broken in by a native, who hurt him
about the head, after which, he had a great
antipathy to natives; indeed, he had a dislike
to any strangers. After a time, he got
to know me; but if a native tried to touch
him, he became almost frantic. He was a
very easy horse for riding, and I became
quite fond of him, and used to feed and give
him water. One day we were all out riding,
and as we came toward the house, I galloped
into the yard and dismounted on the
stone wall, which we used as a horse-block.
They called to me that they were going on,
so, as I had the bridle in my hand, I prepared
to mount, when a good native deacon
came forward to help me. The horse's nostrils
dilated, and he plunged about almost
drawing me off the wall, and was the perfect
image of anger. I succeeded in making
the good man understand that he must go
away, then talked soothingly to the horse,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
patted his head gently, and finally, as he
came near enough, threw myself into the
saddle, and had a good ride. Now you see,
children, what kindness can do. If I had
ever been rough with the horse, or unkind
to him, he would not have had such confidence
in me, and I could not have soothed
him down, and so should have lost my
ride.</p>

<h2><a name="XII" id="XII"></a>XII.<br /><br />

Kaawaloa.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapm"><span class="dropcap">M</span></span>Y little flock of listeners
were sure to get their
work done punctually by
four o'clock, thus fulfilling
their part of the
bargain, and used laughingly
to talk about their
travels, making believe
that they were journeying, as I told them
what I saw and had passed through.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">On Saturday, April 4, Mr. Paris, grandpa,
and I, started off on a long ride, to visit
Hoonaunau, the city of refuge, a place to
which people could flee, if they had committed
any crime, or displeased any chief,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
and be protected by the priests. This was
in old pagan times; they are not used for
that purpose now.</p>

<p>"Aunty," asked Carrie, "didn't they have
such cities in Old Testament times?"</p>

<p>Yes, dear, they did. You may get your
Bible and turn to Numbers xxxv: vi. and
read the passage to us.</p>

<p>"And among the cities which ye shall
give unto the Levites, there shall be six
cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for
the man-slayer, that he may flee thither."</p>

<p>It seems singular that this heathen people
should have a custom like that sanctioned
by God through Moses in the Old
Testament days; but so it was. This city
of refuge was a "heiau," or heathen temple.
It has a massive stone wall varying from six
to ten feet in hight, and as many feet in
thickness, inclosing a large space of ground,
and having, of course, no roof. The sea
washes its base on one side. Here we saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
a rock, under which Kaahumanu, the favorite
wife of the great conqueror Kamehameha I.,
is said to have hid herself when her
royal husband was angry with her. It is
called by her name.</p>

<p>"Did the king have more than one
wife?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>Yes, almost every chief had several, if he
could afford it. But now that they are a
Christianized people it is different.</p>

<p>We stood on the altar where human sacrifices
had been offered. It was hard to believe
that such a quiet place was ever used
for so dreadful a purpose.</p>

<p>We saw a flat rock, on which one of the
great chiefs was said to have rested while
his subjects were fishing. The native story
is, that the chief was so tall that his feet
hung over one end, and his head the other.
The stone was fourteen feet long!</p>

<p>"Aunty," said little Alice, "it wasn't a
true story; was it?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>No, Alice; but probably he was a very
tall man.</p>

<p>We passed over the battle-field of Kaei,
the scene of the last great fight on Hawaii,
which placed the island under the rule of
Kamehameha II.</p>

<p>About half a mile beyond the City of
Refuge is a high bluff, over which are solid
lava falls, looking just like a waterfall, only
black. They are hundreds of feet broad and
more than a hundred feet high. You can
walk between the bluff and the fall, and look
up a hundred feet. We went into a cave,
which is an eighth of a mile deep, leading to
the sea. It probably was once a channel
through which a lava stream flowed into the
ocean.</p>

<p>Coming back we rode into the village of
Kealakekua, and went to the spot where
Captain Cook was worshiped, and had sacrifices
offered to him. Just think how wicked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
it was in him to allow those poor ignorant
natives to believe he was a god, and to
receive offerings and sacrifices as such! It
must have been very displeasing in the sight
of God to have a man brought up in a
Christian land do such a thing. It was only
a little while after, across the bay in sight of
that very place, that he lost his life. We
saw two cocoa-nut trees with their trunks
perforated by cannon-balls which were fired
from Cook's ship.</p>

<p>The next day we attended the native
church at Kealakekua, and saw their manner
of collecting monthly concert money.
One or two deacons, or "lunas" as they call
them, sit at a table in front of the pulpit, and
the people bring up their gifts. Three old
men had no money, and brought, respectively,
a broom, some dried fish, and two fowls.
The fowls amused me very much. They
had their feet tied together, and occasionally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
fluttered their wings and clucked during
the sermon. One of the hens, I have since
learned, was of Japanese breed. All her
feathers curled up the wrong way, making
her look as if she had been out in a gale of
wind.</p>

<p>Monday we rode down to Kaawaloa, stood
on the rock where Cook fell, gathered some
coral where his boat rested, and walked
over the stones where he led the king when
endeavoring to take him as a hostage.</p>

<p>"What did they want him for?" asked
Harry.</p>

<p>The natives had stolen a boat from Captain
Cook, and the latter was taking their king
to the ship to keep him there until the boat
should be brought back. The natives could
not bring the boat back, because they had
already broken it up to get the iron in it;
and they were not willing their king should
be taken away. So one of the chiefs seized
Cook roughly by the shoulder, and held him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
so painfully that he cried out. The people
said, "Can a god groan? Is a god afraid?"
Their belief that he was a god was broken,
and he was immediately killed. We went
into the king's house, which is still standing,
and saw some beautiful matting lining the
walls, taking the place of our house paper.
It was woven in figures. We sat down on
a board, and drank some young cocoa-nut
milk from trees which existed in Captain
Cook's time, and now shade the spot. Near
the shore is a dead trunk of a tree about
three feet high, on which several plates of
copper, inscribed to the memory of Captain
Cook, have been nailed by officers of British
men-of-war. Not a very sumptuous monument
this! On one side of the road, about
half a mile above the beach, is a pillar of
wood erected on a heap of rough lava. On
this is a small plate, bearing this inscription:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
In Memory<br />
<small>OF</small><br />
<big>CAPTAIN JAMES COOK, R. N.,</big><br />
WHO DISCOVERED THESE ISLANDS,<br />
<small>IN</small><br />

<small>THIS HUMBLE MONUMENT IS ERECTED BY</small><br />
<small>HIS FELLOW COUNTRYMEN, IN</small><br />

</p>

<p>Captain Cook named the group of islands
from his patron, the Earl of Sandwich. The
natives always call them Hawaiian Islands,
or as they say, "Hawaii Nei!"</p>

<p>This portion of Hawaii is the orange district,
and we had delicious oranges every
day. It seemed sometimes as if the fruit,
after peeling, would drop to pieces in our
hands, from very juiciness.</p>

<p>"Oh, how I wish I had some!" said
Harry.</p>

<p>This is a bread-fruit country too. We
didn't learn to love that fruit. We some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>times
had it baked for dinner. I think it is
never eaten uncooked. The tree is fine-looking;
its leaves are large, and of a very
brilliant green. The fruit is round, has a
rough outside, and to me seemed rather
mealy and tasteless.</p>

<p>"How large is it?" asked Carrie.</p>

<p>About the size of a cantelope-melon.</p>

<p>We tasted here, too, the root of the ti [te]
plant. It was baked, and when sent in it
was still hot. It looked like brown-bread,
only finer grained, and when shaved off in
slices had a very sweet and not unpleasant
taste. Many of the natives are quite fond
of it. The plant has a small trunk four or
five feet high, surmounted with a tuft of
leaves resembling corn-leaves. In various
parts of the islands, when there is a scarcity
of food, the natives eat the root of the fern-tree,
baked. It reminded me in appearance
of tobacco, was tasteless, and uninviting in
its looks; but I saw native men cut off great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
slices of it, which they ate as if they liked
it. But as I told you before, their favorite
food is poi, and, with a good supply of that
and raw fish, a native is as happy as a plenty
of good food can make him.</p>

<p>We saw here for the first time enormous
cockroaches. They came out after a rain,
and were very annoying, as all large bugs
are that can fly or run fast. One night I
killed seven in my room. If I left one dead
on the floor overnight, in the morning it
would be surrounded by hundreds of small
brown ants. It was really very interesting
to watch the little creatures. They would
saw off a leg, or a part of one, then several
of them would drag it away to their hiding-place;
and, piecemeal, they would, if given
time, carry off the cockroach, leaving not a
particle. Now there is a lesson for you,
children.</p>

<p>Perhaps you have something to do. It
may seem like a mountain, as you look at it;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
but if you work diligently, doing perhaps
only a little at a time, it will grow less and
less until it is all done; and as you look back
upon it, you will be astonished to think how
easily you have done it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

Kailua.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">"A</span></span>UNTY," said Carrie, as I
came into the room, at four
o'clock the next day, "we
have been calling ourselves
little ants all day to-day, we
have been so busy; but
now we have finished our
work, and are all ready."
So I resumed my story.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">On Saturday, April 11, we left Kaawaloa,
after a very pleasant visit of two weeks,
starting about nine o'clock on our twelve
miles' ride to Kailua. Mr. Paris's family and
grandma were in a carriage, which some
friends had given Mrs. P., and grandpa and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
I were on horseback. I had my horse
Bonaparte. The road was good most of
the way; no carriage had ever traveled the
whole length of it before. Part of the way
was down the mountain, and when about
half-way to the foot, a part of the carriage
broke. We all dismounted and took a
lunch, then, with some leather, Mr. Paris
bound up the broken place firmly, and we
went on our way rejoicing that no worse
thing had befallen us; for we were far
away from any house, and had still half of
our journey to perform, and this being the
only carriage on that part of the island, no
native knew how to repair it. On reaching
the sea-shore, we passed through a grove of
cocoa-nut trees. Here we drank some
delicious cocoa-nut milk, and quite a group
of natives gathered about us, and shook
hands. The Hawaiians as a race are very
fond of shaking hands. As the shake of
the hand, saying "aloha," love to you, was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
often our only mode of expressing our interest,
we were very particular to do it.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

</div>

<p>After leaving the grove, the path lay
between two stone walls, so near together
that it seemed impossible for the carriage to
go through. Our native friends said among
themselves "<i>pilikia!</i>" trouble; for there was
no other road for the carriage. But the
carriage did pass, the wheels just grazing
the stones. How glad we were, and the
natives exclaimed, "<i>maikai!</i>" good.</p>

<p>We saw a great deal of rough hard lava,
called "pahoihoi," and prickly pear-trees
grew in abundance. They were large, ugly
plants. Grandma gave me one of their
flowers which looks like a cactus-blossom.
I had on a heavy buckskin glove, and this
was filled with small barbed thorns, which,
before I knew it, had worked through into
my hand, as I held the rein. They caused
no little pain, but were so small and colorless
that you could not see them. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
places the people use the prickly pear as
hedges, which are unsightly but very strong.
We often saw the century-plant while on the
islands, which, it has been said, blooms only
once in one hundred years; but in fact it
blossoms at least once in twenty-five years.
The stalk of the flower grows very rapidly.
Some of these stalks are twenty or thirty
feet high. I examined one which seemed
to be casting its blossoms; they looked like
small bulbs just sprouting. If these are
planted, they will grow, and this is the way
the plant is propagated.</p>

<p>We were amused at the excitement of
many of the natives about the carriage. A
great number of them had never seen one
before. Whole families turned out, men,
women, and children, just as people in our
own land once did to see a railroad car, or
as they do now to see a caravan with elephants
and camels. Horses and mules all
along the road became unmanageable. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
would turn and look, with dilated nostrils
and head erect, while trembling in every
limb, till the carriage almost reached them,
then they would break from their fastenings
and gallop off, neighing with fear. Then
they would turn and look till we nearly
reached them again, when they darted away
as before.</p>

<p>We reached the house of Mr. Thurston,
at Kailua, about three o'clock in the afternoon.
It had a very desolate look, for it
had been locked up for a year. The venerable
missionaries were then in California, on
account of the failure of Mr. T.'s health.
There was no white face to greet us, as at
the other mission-stations, so we made ourselves
as comfortable as possible. Several
natives called to see us, and a venerable
deacon sent us two fowls, some very fine
watermelons, and sweet potatoes. The
melons were delicious, the soil of this part
of the islands being well adapted to them.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
Watermelons are even sent to the San Francisco
market.</p>

<p>The next day was Sabbath, the 12th of
April, the forty-third anniversary of the
missionaries first landing on these islands,
which occurred on this very spot. We were
interested in the fact that we should happen
to be there at that time.</p>

<p>We went to the stone church, a venerable
edifice built in the old style,&mdash;the pulpit and
galleries being very high. Perhaps a thousand
natives were present, and they paid
remarkable attention to all that was said.
After service, we shook hands with a large
portion of the audience. Most of the
people came on horseback, and there must
have been as many as five hundred horses
tied outside the church.</p>

<p>It was too far for us to go home before
the afternoon service; so we spent the time
in visiting the graves of mission families
near the church. In the afternoon we par<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>took
of the communion with the congregation.
Every thing was conducted with great
propriety. A native evangelist has had the
care of this church since Mr. T. left, and
they have well sustained their church and
prayer-meetings, with very little outside
aid from missionaries.</p>

<p>We expected the steamer to call for us at
any time after midnight, and so slept with
one eye and one ear open. About twenty
asses were in a pasture near us, and were
braying all night long. We had little
refreshing sleep, and were glad to see the
smoke of the Kilauea as she came round a
point in the distance at six o'clock in the
morning. We wended our way to the
beach, and amused ourselves by watching
little native children playing in the water,
and by picking up shells, until the boat
came to take us on board the steamer, when
we bade our friends good-by. As there was
no wharf, a native took us up one by one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
and carried us to the boat. It seemed so
funny at first for us grown people to be
taken up like children; but we got accustomed
to it, the men lifting us easily, and
placing us in the boat as dry and comfortable
as possible. By three o'clock in the afternoon
we were off Honoipu, where we were to
disembark. This is the landing for Kohala.
Mr. Bond met us, and a kind German was
there with his wagon to take grandma and
the baggage to Mr. B.'s house. The rest of
us went on horseback. Before grandpa
mounted his horse, the natives gathered
about him, and asked by an interpreter how
old he was. They said, "his face and his
form was young, but his hair was old."
They expected to see an old decrepit man,
and were quite surprised to find him so
fresh and vigorous. We started on a brisk
canter over a good road. My horse was
unfortunate in his disposition, and would
sometimes run across the road to kick
another.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, aunty, what did he do that for?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>Perhaps he had the same feeling that a
little boy has, when he races with another
boy. The latter runs a little faster perhaps,
and the boy that is behind tries to hinder or
tease him in some way, so that he may
lose the race. I suppose my horse didn't
want the other to pass him, and so tried to
kick him.</p>

<p>The trade-wind swept across that part of
the island with great force. It really
seemed as if we would be blown off our
horses, and I was glad that my hat-strings
were sewed on tightly. After a while, a sudden
shower came up, lasting about five minutes;
but the wind soon dried us. Another
and heavier one making its appearance in
the distance, we turned off the road to go a
shorter way. Mr. Bond was mounted on a
large white mule; as we were galloping
hastily along over the grassy field, his mule<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
stumbled, and over they went. All we
could see was the mule's four feet in the
air. Fortunately, Mr. Bond was not under
the animal, as we feared, but rose from the
soft grass a few feet ahead uninjured. The
shower came steadily on, and we were
obliged to take refuge in a native hut. The
natives ran out, took off our saddles, and
tied our horses for us, so that we might
escape the shower. They were always
ready to do a kind act for us. As I sat in
the hut with two women and a pretty little
native girl about three years old, I longed to
be able to talk with them in their own
language; but after each of us had said
"aloha," we could only sit and look at each
other.</p>

<p>Grandma and Mrs. Bond with her children
were waiting on the piazza to meet us
as we rode up. But there is the tea-bell, so
we must wait until to-morrow to hear about
Kohala.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIV" id="XIV"></a>XIV.<br /><br />

Kohala and Waimea.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">"W</span></span>E are ready to hear about
that queer-named place
now, aunty," said Alice
at my elbow as I sat
writing in my room.</p>

<p>Oh, yes, about Kohala.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Every thing at Mr. Bond's was the pink
of neatness, and though we were shut in
by rain for five days, we enjoyed it. Sometimes,
it would look like clearing up, and
we would walk in the garden; but usually
we had to hurry in to escape the rain.</p>

<p>The garden looked beautifully, with some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
rose-bushes twenty-five feet in circumference,
and scarlet geraniums perhaps fifteen
feet. It does one good just to look at them,
after seeing only our little dwarf shrubs at
home. Kanoa and his wife, the good
Hawaiian missionaries to Micronesia, came
with their little baby to bid us good-by.</p>

<p>We had mangoes for the first time at Mr.
Bond's, which were delicious. In shape
they are like a pear, only flatter, with the
large end growing next the stem. I can not
describe the taste, it is unlike any thing we
have. The seed is very large, being nearly
two thirds the size of the fruit. Fresh figs,
too, we tried for the first time, and to our
surprise liked them. We had some papaias,
which grow on trees; the fruit tastes like a
musk-melon, and pies made of them are
very much like squash-pies.</p>

<p>Sabbath morning it cleared up about
eleven, so that we could go to church.
Notwithstanding the weather, a goodly congregation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
assembled, and listened to grandpa
with great respect and attention. After
meeting, as usual, they all wanted to shake
hands with us. As I was going down the
aisle, thinking I had shaken hands with all,
I heard some one call "keika mahine,
keika mahine" [daughter, daughter], and
looking round, there was an old man standing
up on a seat with his hand stretched
out to shake hands. Of course I must
gratify him. Fortunately for us, Monday,
April 20, was a pleasant day, and we started
about nine o'clock for Waimea across the
mountain. Grandma rode about twelve
miles in Mr. Christianson's wagon, and then
as the wagon-road ended, she went the
remainder of the way on horseback. The
rest of us were in the saddle all the way.
How the wind did blow! It seemed as if
I should be carried out of my saddle bodily;
but we rode on over fields and barren
wastes, and through steep and rocky<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
gulches. At noon we reached the house of
a foreigner, and were hospitably entertained.
Mr. Lyons was waiting for us there, and
Mr. Bond left us. What was more to us
than dinner, was a feast of home letters,
which Mr. Lyons had brought for us.
After resting an hour or more, we were all
in our saddles again. As we were riding,
on the summit of a hill, or mountain as we
should call it, a beautiful scene opened before
us. High above us the fleecy clouds
parted, and we caught a glimpse of what
seemed like "the promised land." There
stood the peak of a lofty mountain covered
with newly-fallen snow, shining white and
beautiful in the sun's clear beams. It
seemed too high up, too pure and fair in its
framework of clouds, to belong to earth.
This was the summit of Mauna Kea, and
we shall not soon forget that vision of beauty.
It seemed as if angels might flit over its
snowy sides without any danger of soiling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
their pure white garments. We arrived at
Mr. Lyons's about five, and were cordially
met by Mrs. L. and her daughter.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we attended a meeting
at Mr. Lyons's church. The house was
filled with nicely-dressed natives. Grandpa
and Mr. L. sat in front of the pulpit. At
the back of the church was a large choir of
men and women, who sung well and with
animation, beating time with their hands.</p>

<p>Soon after we entered, they sung an
original hymn by a native named Lyana,
which the choir sung to the tune of "Hendon."</p>

<p>Mr. Bingham, one of the first missionaries

<p>Grandpa then made an address, and told
them about the missions in Western Asia.
Then Kanoa, the missionary to Micronesia,
made a prayer; after which, he and his
wife sung a Micronesian hymn. Grandpa
told them, in another short address, about
the India missions. Mr. Lyons then arose
and spoke about his own mission, and introduced
his senior deacon, Timotao Nalanipo,
who made a speech in Hawaiian. Mr.
Lyons translated it, and I will read you the
translation.</p>

<p>"The church-members of the highlands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
of Waimea, the old men, the aged women,
the strong men, the youth and children
tender, through me, their salutation to you,
the secretary, your companion, and daughter.
Great, indeed, is our joy in being permitted
to see you, to welcome you to our
land. You have been sent by the learned
Missionary Society of great America, as its
delegate, to see the works of the gospel
heralds you have sent to us.</p>

<p>"We, the ancient men of Kamehameha's
time, were once idolaters, murderers, guilty
of infanticide, polygamy, and constantly
quarreling one with another. On the
death of Kamehameha, the kingdom devolved
on his son Liholiho. He abolished
idolatry, broke the tabus; men and women
for the first time ate together, and the
temples and gods were burned to ashes.</p>

<p>"Still we lived on in poverty and darkness,
and in secret worship of idols, and
were without the knowledge of the living<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
and true God. Men, women, and children
were promiscuously devoted to the most
sordid pleasures, heathenish dances, and
revelries, day and night. In the year 1820,
the missionaries, Mr. Bingham and company,
came to these islands to proclaim the
blessed gospel to us, who knew not God,
nor had heard of the death of Jesus, the
Messiah, the Saviour of the world. It was
you, the Missionary Society you represent,
that loved us, and sent the good missionaries
to our dark land.</p>

<p>"The king and his premier allowed the
missionaries to dwell with us to introduce
a new order of things; to teach us first the
twelve letters of the alphabet, then spelling,
then reading and writing.</p>

<p>"During the forty-three years the missionaries
have resided on the islands, much
seed has been sown, much labor performed,
and wonderful have been the results. We
were once all dark, buried in darkness, sunk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
to the lowest depths of ignorance, roaming
about the fields and woods, like wild beasts,
without clothing, our naked bodies most
shamefully exposed and blackened by the
sun, without books, without Bibles, without
Christianity, plunging into the darkness of
hell. Now we are clothed, like civilized
beings; we are Christianized; we are gathered
into churches; we are intelligent;
we are supplied with books, Bibles and
hymn-books; and are living for God and for
heaven; and this through the labors of the
missionaries you have sent us.</p>

<p>"Our joy is inexpressible in seeing you;
and we beg you to carry back to your associates,
to the Missionary Society, to all the
American churches connected with it, the
warmest salutations of the churches of
Waimea and Hamakua."</p>

<p>This good old man has since died, and
gone, doubtless, to be with his Lord whom
he so long loved and served.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>At the close of the Hawaiian address,
another original native hymn was sung,
composed by Samuela, and sung to the tune
of "Farewell, farewell is a lonely sound."</p>

</div></div>

<p>After this was sung, we shook hands
with nearly all in the church. Many,
to our embarrassment, brought little tokens
of good-will in money, amounting in all to
ten dollars. With this we bought Hawaiian
Bibles to be distributed among the
people. Imagine a man, coming up to
shake hands, but stopping before he did it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
diving his hand into the pocket of his
pantaloons, taking out a quarter of a dollar
and laying it on the table, then shaking
hands as if he had paid for it! They have,
however, none of that feeling.</p>

<p>The tea-bell! the tea-bell!</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XV" id="XV"></a>XV.<br /><br />

Maui.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapf"><span class="dropcap">F</span></span>OUR o'clock came, and with it
my little folks, all ready for a
story. So I commenced.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We left Waimea on the
morning of April 23, and rode
on horseback to Kowaihae,
a distance of twelve miles;
there we were to take the steamer Kilauea.</p>

<p>On our way down to the shore we visited
a heiau [hay-ow], or heathen temple. It
was built by Kamehameha I. at the time
he was going over to conquer Maui
[Mow-e]. This was the last temple built
on Hawaii. All the inhabitants of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
island, men and women, were commanded
to come and help build it, and none dared
to stay away. It is about two hundred
feet square, twenty-five feet high, and as
many feet thick, of solid stone, just like
a massive wall. Within we saw where the
sacrifices were laid overnight, and the pit
where they were thrown in the morning,&mdash;a
place called by the natives hell.</p>

<p>"What were their sacrifices, aunty?"
asked Willie.</p>

<p>Human beings,&mdash;generally lame or
maimed persons. Before Kamehameha I.
left for the conquest of Maui, thirteen
human sacrifices are said to have been
offered on this altar to insure him success.</p>

<p>After being hospitably entertained by a
son of Judge Allen at Kowaihae, we went
on board the steamer about eight o'clock in
the evening, and soon Hawaii was left
behind in the darkness. We had finished
our tour of that island, and saw it no more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>We had a rough night, and did not arrive
at Kalepolepo, Maui, until twelve o'clock.
We went on shore in a high wind, and
landed in a storm of sand.</p>

<p>"A storm of <i>sand</i>, aunty! What do you
mean?" asked Carrie.</p>

<p>Just what I say,&mdash;a storm of sand. The
wind was so strong that the very sand was
blown up in our faces with such force as to
make the skin tingle.</p>

<p>Mr. Alexander met us, and we started in
this same storm and high wind for Wailuku,
ten miles distant, where he resides. Even
the gentlemen had veils over their faces, and
hats tied on with handkerchiefs. The air
was so thick with sand that we could hardly
see, but we pushed bravely on. We were
all on horseback, our baggage coming on
more slowly in an ox-cart.</p>

<p>We had just got within sight of Mr.
Alexander's house, having only a ride of
perhaps ten minutes before us, when, to our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
dismay, there came a deluge of rain. My
veil in a moment became like ground glass,
the water making it impossible for me to see
through it. Of course I could not guide my
horse, but he followed the rest of the company;
and glad indeed were we to change
our soaked garments for others kindly furnished
by the mission family, and thankful
that our baggage did not arrive until after
the shower was over, so that it escaped
getting wet.</p>

<p>The next day we had a visit from many
native men and women, who brought their
gifts of eggs, onions, cabbages, fowls, and
melons. They all seemed so genuinely
happy to see us that it was a pleasure to
meet them.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath we attended church all
day, with a well-dressed and decorous congregation
of Hawaiians. They had a melodeon
and a very good choir. Mr. Alexander
told us that six of the choir could play on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
the instrument, and they all take turns, one
playing in the morning, another in the
afternoon. They hired a teacher to come
over from Lahaina once or twice a week.
This they planned entirely among themselves,
I believe.</p>

<p>Monday morning we made up a party to
go into Iao [E-ah-o] valley. We were all
on horseback,&mdash;nine of us,&mdash;and a happy
company we were. The valley was so narrow
that we crossed a swollen and rapid
mountain stream five times. The ascent the
last part of the way, before reaching the
plateau, was very steep. But oh, what a
magnificent valley we were in! It was
about three miles long, and from one to two
broad, while all around us, excepting the
side we entered, were precipices from four
to six or seven thousand feet high, in many
instances perpendicular. It was a grand
sight, to be remembered for a lifetime.</p>

<p>We dismounted from our horses, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
younger portion of the company rambled in
the woods in search of tree-shells.</p>

<p>"<i>Tree-shells!</i> What are they, aunty?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>They are snail-shells. I think I was told
that over a hundred varieties are found on
the islands, every valley and each hundred
feet of elevation having a different species.
We used to notice the kind of tree that
seemed to have the most, and then searched
for that tree. They prefer the under sides
of the leaves; so we would peer up in the
branches, and when we found one, would
pick it off and drop it in our pocket-handkerchief.
After we were tired of "shelling," we
came back to where our elders were quietly
chatting, and had a nice picnic lunch, sitting
on the grass, with fern-leaves for plates.
What a sight was before our eyes!&mdash;these
majestic works of God rising thousands of
feet above us, apparently resting in clouds!</p>

<p>Towards the entrance of the valley is a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
very peculiar peak, called "The Needle,"
from its being so sharp and pointed. I
wanted very much to sketch it, but started
off without my materials; however grandpa
had a note-book and pencil, and I knew
that he would be willing to give me a leaf;
but while we were off shelling, he left the
valley and went back to Wailuku with Mr.
Alexander, they having no time for picnicking;
so what was I to do? Some of the
lunch had been wrapped in white paper,
which I smoothed out, and relied on some
of the party for a pencil. When we got
opposite "The Needle," I stopped my horse,
and prepared myself for sketching, but not
a pencil could be found among all the party.
What do you think I did? I took a pin,
and pricked the outline, and places where
the heavy shading was to be, and after I got
home drew the picture. This "Needle" has
an historical interest. You remember I told
you that the heathen temple near Kowaihae<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
was built by Kamehameha I. before he left
for the conquest of Maui. It was in this
Iao valley that the people of Maui met the
king's forces. A band of warriors with their
families took refuge on this "Needle," which
is accessible at such places only as could
be easily defended against a large number.
The enemy tried to starve them out, but
failed. They then made believe they had
left the valley, but at night hid themselves
on the banks of the mountain stream where
the warriors would go down to drink. As
these poor deluded people came to quench
their thirst, they murdered them all, men,
women, and children. The stream flowed
red with blood for two hours. That was
heathen warfare, cruel and bloodthirsty, and
this was the last battle fought on Maui; for
the island became subject to the rule of
Kamehameha I.</p>

</div>

<p>At six o'clock Wednesday morning, we
started on horseback for Maanea's Landing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
seven miles off, on the opposite side of the
bay from Kalepolepo, expecting to take a
whale-boat to Lahaina; but no whale-boat
was there, so we had to return, bag and
baggage, to Mr. Alexander's. We rode back
the distance of seven miles in an hour,
which we thought was doing very well, as
grandma kept her place in the cavalcade
all the way.</p>

<p>We passed over miles of land desolated
by a waterspout which broke on the mountains,
rolling down a flood of water with vast
quantities of earth and stone into the valley
below.</p>

<p>"What is a <i>waterspout</i>?"</p>

<p>It is a sort of whirlwind at sea; a body
of water is caught up by the wind, sometimes
joining the cloud above it, and rolling
on until it meets with some obstacle, when
it breaks, and washes away houses and
trees, or anything movable. It will sink a
ship if it strikes it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>The next morning we went down again
to the shore, and were more successful, for
the boat was there waiting for us. As the
wind was fair, the boat-boys raised their sail,
and we danced over the waves swiftly and
merrily. After an hour's easy sailing, the
wind left us, and our men took their oars
for a two hours' rowing to Lahaina. For a
part of the time we passed through shallow
water over a coral reef, where we could look
down upon forests of coral, shaped like
branches of trees, white, or tinged slightly
with red or green. It was a beautiful sight,
and I longed to get some to bring home.
We came safely through the surf. Lahaina
looks beautifully as you approach it from
the sea. It has some very pretty houses,
and they seem to be embowered by cocoa-nut
and other trees, so that the whole scene
is more tropical in its appearance than any
other place on the islands. We landed at
the same spot where we had done six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
weeks before, and found our friends all
ready to greet us, having seen our boat approaching.
Our three hours' sail had been
a very pleasant one, and the only sail we
had had in a whale-boat.</p>

<p>After dinner, without stopping to rest,
we mounted our horses, and sped up the
hill to Lahainaluna, a distance of two miles,
over a hot, dusty road, to attend the examination
of the native seminary or college
there. Most of the services were conducted
in an unknown tongue, but the answers were
prompt, and seemed to be in most instances
satisfactory. After sitting and hearing recitations
for about three hours, we left, and
visited some of the rooms of the students.
They looked very neat and clean, many of
them having gay patchwork quilts on their
beds, and quite a number of them had our
illustrated newspapers pinned on the wall,
with their favorite general occupying a conspicuous
place.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p>The first of May was commencement day.
The exercises were held in the church
at Lahaina. We went down about nine.
The alumni walked in a procession to the
church, and were a fine-looking, intelligent
set of men. The addresses were very creditable.
The audience were attentive and
quiet, and were well-dressed. The singing
was very good,&mdash;Hawaiian words set to
some of our familiar college tunes, which
were sung with a great deal of spirit.</p>

<p>After the exercises in the church, the
alumni had a dinner in the yard of the
church, under a grove of cocoa-nut trees.
The foreign guests were honored with a
table by themselves, and were served by
students. At the end of the table was a pig
roasted whole, stuffed with greens, baked
with hot stones in one of their ovens in the
ground. This dish they call "luau" [lu-ow].
Besides whole pig, they had other
pork, veal, poi, bread, cake, and cocoa-nut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
water. The whole dinner was well-served,
and the white guests showed their appreciation
of the good things by making a
hearty dinner.</p>

<p>But we must wait for our ride in Lahaina
until to-morrow.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XVI" id="XVI"></a>XVI.<br /><br />

Lahaina&mdash;Kauai.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapc"><span class="dropcap">"C</span></span>OME, aunty," called Alice,
"we want to take our ride
in Lahaina."</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We started soon after the
alumni dinner, and rode
down towards the beach,
where we saw the American
consul's residence, a cozy, thatched
house, then turned off upon a road leading
to the hospital. Here is the finest
grove of cocoa-nut trees to be seen anywhere
on the group of islands. Soon
after the arrival of the missionaries, they
perceived that no one planted cocoa-nuts,
and that there was danger of the trees dying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
out. A missionary was talking to a high
chief woman, and said to her, "Why don't
you plant cocoa-nuts, so that trees may
grow?" "Oh! I shall never live to eat
them," she carelessly remarked. "True,"
said the missionary, "you may not live to
eat them, but your children may live and
enjoy the fruit."</p>

<p>She thought a few moments; a new idea
seemed to have entered that mind just coming
out from the darkness of heathenism
into the light of Christianity. She had
been accustomed only to think of herself,
and what she might enjoy. It had never
occurred to her that she could do anything
for those who came after her until now,
and she said, "It shall be done;" and
within twenty-four hours, a schooner was
sent off, which brought a load of cocoa-nuts,
and these were planted where now is that
beautiful cocoa-nut grove.</p>

<p>On returning from this grove, we passed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
by fields of sugar-cane, and visited Mr.
Spencer's sugar-mill. It was a sweet place,
and sticky too! They have a mill turned
by twelve or fourteen mules in spans, which
grinds the cane and presses out the juice.
Then there are several vats in a row, with
fires under them, where the juice is boiled.
The sugar is clarified by lime-water; it is
then put into round sieves which turn with
great rapidity, and through which the syrup
is pressed, leaving a clean-looking, dry,
brown sugar. That is the process as near
as I remember it. They make barrels in
the same building, so that the sugar leaves
the mill all ready for exporting.</p>

<p>Lahaina is a very dusty place, the earth
is red and sticky. If we stayed there long,
it seemed as if not only our clothes, but we
ourselves, must become copper-colored.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath, May 3, a large assembly
met at the church, and grandpa addressed
them. They listened as usual with great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
attention, and after the service was over,
they all flocked about him, wishing to shake
hands. The communion service was in the
afternoon, and all the ministers present took
part. It was an interesting service, natives
and foreigners sitting together around their
Lord's table. Several friends in the mission
coming together in the evening, at Dr.
Baldwin's house, we sung hymns for an
hour to our dear home tunes. It recalled
to some of us our own loved America and
the family circle where in years gone by we
had sung with these friends the same tunes.</p>

<p>On Monday we attended an exhibition
of Mr. Dwight Baldwin's native school. It
was very interesting. The dialogues were
exciting, even though in an unknown tongue
and spoken by little boys; for they acted
them out thoroughly, seeming to forget the
spectators entirely. The singing was spirited
and in good time. There was none of
that painful shyness and hesitation which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
we sometimes see in our American schools,
and we greatly enjoyed the scene.</p>

<p>Tuesday being our last day in Lahaina, a
great many natives came to see us, bringing
little love-tokens,&mdash;one or two shells such
as they wear for bracelets, or a pretty wreath
of yellow feathers such as are worn for a
necklace. At seven in the evening, attended
by quite a cavalcade of natives and
other friends, we went on board the steamer
Kilauea, and soon had our last view of
Maui, as we slowly steamed away, and the
darkness came on.</p>

<p>We entered the port of Honolulu at about
ten the next morning, having been absent
on our tour of the islands of Hawaii and
Maui fifty-eight days. Our welcome from
the friends in Honolulu was very hearty.
The calls upon us commenced as soon as
we reached Mr. Clark's, and each day
we dined or took tea or lunched with
some one of the mission families.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Saturday morning, May 9, was spent in
calling on the old Governor Kekuanaoa,
and his daughter, the Princess Victoria, the
father and sister of the present and late
kings. They live in a very pretty-looking
house, with a garden attached to it. The
governor has a grapery, and presented us
with some fine bunches of grapes. There
were some very long canoes being made on
his premises, consisting each of the trunk
of a tree, scooped out and prettily finished.</p>

<p>Monday afternoon we went on board
the little steam-schooner, Annie Laurie,
bound for the island of Kauai [Kow-i].
Hon. R. C. Wyllie was on board, and a band
of music accompanied us for a short distance.
Music is music the world over, but
this was the only brass band on the islands.</p>

<p>One of the gentlemen on board was asked,
the next morning, how he felt, and replied,
"I feel as if I had swallowed a kitten and
a mouse, and the kitten was after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
mouse!"&mdash;the best description I have ever
heard of sea-sickness.</p>

<p>We arrived at Hanalei, Kauai, about
twelve on Tuesday, and were met on the
beach by the missionaries, Messrs. Johnson
and Wilcox, who escorted us on horseback
to the house of the former gentleman. The
next morning we breakfasted at Mr. Wilcox's,
then at twelve had a meeting in the
church, where a goodly number of natives
were assembled; among them Kanoa, the
governor of Kauai, who afterwards dined
with us.</p>

<p>At three o'clock, Mr. Wyllie sent down a
boat for our party, to take us to his estate,
called Princeville. It was a delightful row
up the river, the foliage on either bank was
the richest and most luxuriant we had seen.
There was hardly a ripple on the water, and
no sound was to be heard but the gentle dip
of the oars.</p>

<p>First, we visited the sugar-mill, which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
the finest and most expensive on the islands.
There we witnessed the whole process, from
the grinding of the cane to the grained
sugar. After that we went up to the agent's
house, and were cordially welcomed by his
family, and shown over the beautiful garden
surrounding the house. There was a
hedge of lovely roses, with a profusion of
fragrant blossoms. They gave us strawberries,
peaches, pine-apples, and sugar-cane
to take with us,&mdash;a citron, too, such
as our preserved citron for cake is made of.
It looked like an enormous lemon. Besides
this, we had an elegant bouquet of flowers,&mdash;a
magnificent fragrant magnolia, that queen
of flowers, looking so waxen with its heavy
white leaves, and in beautiful contrast with
it the scarlet pomegranate blossoms: a
fair white lily and snowy japonica completed
a bouquet fit for a royal gift.</p>

<p>The view from the piazza is exquisite.
Mountains rise peak above peak in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
distance, while a beautiful valley, with its
meandering stream, lies at your feet. Tropical
trees and lovely flowers are all around
you. I do not wonder that Mr. Wyllie is
proud of Kikiula valley, with its waving
fields of sugar-cane. He called his estate
Princeville after the young Prince of Hawaii,
who is now dead.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning, bright and early,
we started on our travels again. The roads
of Kauai are better than on any of the
other islands. Several members of the
party started a little before the others, and
rode up Kikiula valley through Princeville.
After a ride of about two and a half miles,
we dismounted, and ascended a little eminence.
What a scene was before us! Far
below was the river with its rapids, the
course of which we could trace down
the valley for some distance. Around us
were the mountains, on the left a bluff, and
before us the Twin Peaks, with cascades in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
the distance. We galloped back, and soon
overtook our cavalcade. We had a fine
ride that day through groves of tropical-looking
lohala-trees. Verdant valleys and
lovely cascades, winding streams and wooded
precipices, abound. After fording a narrow
arm of the sea, grandma's horse gave
himself so violent a shake that the girth of
the saddle broke, throwing both her and
the saddle to the ground. Fortunately, no
bones were broken, as where she fell the
sand was quite deep, but she felt the shock
for several days. We lunched at the house
of a German, who kept a small store, and
then rode on several miles to Kealia Park,
the residence of Mr. Krull, a kind German
gentleman, who hospitably entertained us
overnight. Mr. Krull has a large dairy,
which in part supplies the Honolulu market
with butter. He has a well-conducted,
elegant, and tasteful establishment; indeed,
it was difficult to imagine that no lady's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
hand was employed in it. The grounds
about the house are prettily laid out, and
two walks lead to a picturesque summer-house,
called "Bellevue," from which one
looks off over an extensive plain to the sea.
We slept in a nice grass house, with matting
on the side instead of paper. Familiar
engravings adorned the walls, and the beds,
with their pretty muslin mosquito-curtains,
looked inviting enough to the weary traveler.</p>

<p>We saw many kinds of tea-roses, with
their delicate tints. The garden abounded
in a variety of vegetables, and we feasted
on strawberries which were hanging on
their stems in the morning. Within sight
was a fine bluff extending down to the sea.
About fifty feet from the top of the ledge
was a round hole, through which we could
see the sky. The bluff was very steep and
thin, and exceedingly bold in its outlines, as
almost all the ranges of hills are here.</p>

<p>But now we must go to tea.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />

<p><span class="dropcapc"><span class="dropcap">"C</span></span>OME aunty, come!" said
Alice; "Willie and Carrie
sent me to call you." So I
went with my little messenger.</p>



<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We left Mr. Krull's on
the morning of May 15,
and had a sandy and uninteresting ride
until noon. The only pleasant thing
about it, beside good company, was an
exquisite bouquet of beautiful tea-rosebuds,
from our kind entertainer's garden.
At noon a carriage met us, kindly sent by
a foreign resident at Lihue, and the older
members of the party got into it. It was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
heavily-built English barouche drawn by two
horses. Two native outriders, when a steep
hill was to be ascended, attached lassos to
the carriage, which were fastened to their
saddles, so that, with the aid of their horses,
the carriage went steadily and quickly over
the ground, and the occupants had the satisfaction
of riding in a coach and four.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/image174.png" width="600" height="600" alt="Wailua Falls.&mdash;Page 175." title="Wailua Falls.&mdash;Page 175." />
<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Wailua Falls</span>.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_175">175</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>"What are <i>lassos</i>?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>A lasso is a long rope, sometimes made
of leather. It is generally used to catch
wild horses or cattle with; but it did excellent
service in the way in which it was used
that day.</p>

<p>We arrived at Mrs. Rice's, Lihue, in good
season, and stayed there overnight. We
visited another sugar-mill there, and found
it like the others,&mdash;a <i>sweet</i> place.</p>

<p>Early on Saturday morning, I started on
an excursion to Wailua Falls, about six
miles distant. We rode over field and
meadow, when suddenly my companion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
reined in his horse, and came for me to dismount.
"But where are the falls?" said I.
"You will see soon." A few steps brought
me to the brink of an abyss. What a
beautiful scene burst upon my astonished
eye! Right before me was this huge sheet
of water, pouring into a dark circular pool
beneath. One side of the fall was heavy,
the other so thin that it seemed as if every
drop fell by itself; while covering the black
rocks beneath, as if with emerald velvet,
were delicate ferns and mosses. How
pure and fleecy it looked! while far, far
below us the river gleamed like silver
through the leaves. The hight of this fall
is one hundred and eighty-six feet, and it is
fifty feet broad. Two miles farther up the
river is another fall nearly as high, but
divided into two cascades, one about one
hundred feet, the other perhaps seventy.</p>

<p>There is a fine estate not far from the
falls that seemed more like an American<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
country-seat than any I saw on the islands.
A large square house is built upon the edge
of what was once an old crater, but which
is now transformed into a fine garden,
abounding in flowers. This is a dairy-farm,
and is well kept. Our sixteen miles' ride
was performed in less than three hours,
which we thought fast riding, there being
no road most of the way.</p>

<p>We left Lihue at ten o'clock, and rode
over to Koloa, ten miles, in the barouche,
arriving there in time for dinner.</p>

<p>After tea the young people of the mission
went down upon the beach to see the
"Spouting Horn." Through an underground
channel, the waves are driven in
with so much force as to make, through a
small hole in the rock, a fountain forty or
fifty feet high, with a sound that is heard
for some distance. There is also a blow-hole,
reminding one of the volcano, and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
"boiler,"&mdash;a round cavity where the waves
sink, and then suddenly boil over.</p>

<p>On the Sabbath, grandpa addressed the
natives in the morning. The governor of
the island of Kauai was present. In the
afternoon he preached to the foreigners.
Quite a party came over from Lihue, making
a goodly number in all. Almost all
the native churches on the Sandwich Islands
are pretty and neat. The people
seem to take a great deal of pride in them,
and keep them in good repair. All are
furnished with bells, so that the sound of
the "church-going bell" is heard in every
village.</p>

<p>Monday morning we started for Waimea
with a large cavalcade, our friends wishing
to see us safely over the first half of
our way. Mr. Rowell, of Waimea, met us.
The country as we neared Waimea grew
desolate. They had had no rain there
for a year, and nearly all vegetation had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
dried up. Not a blade of grass was seen,
and only a few green trees relieved the eye
in that arid region. The reason of the
drought is that Waimea is on the leeward
side of the mountains, which are a
barrier to the clouds and rain.</p>

<p>"What is <i>leeward</i>?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>On the opposite side from that upon
which the wind blows. We were met with
great cordiality by the entire family. "Old
Jona" came to see us, an aged Hawaiian
of Kamehameha I.'s time. A very interesting
old man he was too.</p>

<p>The next morning there was a meeting
at the church, and grandpa addressed the
natives. "Old Jona" sat in front of the
pulpit, and when anything grandpa said
pleased him particularly, he would turn
round to him, smile, and nod his head. It
was amusing to observe his evident enjoyment.</p>

<p>Some of us went down to the beach. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
tide was coming in, and the boys made what
they called sandboats. They built a bank
in the shape of a boat, and watched to see
the waves wash it away. At length they
made a heavy sand fort, which they called
Sumter, that seemed strong enough to defy
the assaults of the water. Wave after wave
dashed against and over it, and finally it,
too, disappeared like the others.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we rode up into the
valley, where Mr. Rowell's garden is.
There everything was green, in striking
contrast with the scene near his house.
We found some nice peaches, and brought
home a pretty bouquet of white roses and
nasturtions. The next day, Wednesday,
we started for Koloa. Dr. Smith and party
met us at Wahiawa. We stopped to dine
at Mr. Duncan McBride's, a Scotchman's,
where we were sumptuously entertained.
After tea at Dr. Smith's, we embarked on
the steam-schooner Annie Laurie, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
after seven, took our farewell look at the
island of Kauai.</p>

<p>Two nights and a day were spent on the
deck of that schooner, with a chopped sea,
a head-wind, and sea-sickness,&mdash;a weary,
dreary time. We were somewhat comforted
about three o'clock on Friday morning
by hailing the bark Young Hector,
just outside of Honolulu harbor; for we
knew that before long home letters would
be in our hands, and we had received none
for a month. About five o'clock, our steamer
reached the wharf, and we were soon in
our comfortable quarters at Mr. Clark's.
About eight o'clock our letters came.</p>

<p>We had little time for rest; for the next
day, Saturday, May 23, we started on our
tour around Oahu.</p>

<p>We saw among the Moanalua hills a
curious little salt lake, as salt as the sea.
Here a slight shower dampened our clothes,
but not our spirits. About fifteen miles<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
from Honolulu we stopped at Ewa, where
grandpa was to hold a meeting in the
church. Quite a number of natives came,
and we had a pleasant greeting. The lunch
was served for us at Mr. Bishop's house,
and we then resumed our journey over a
good road, and finished our ride of thirty-five
miles about five o'clock. We stayed
at Mr. Emerson's, Waialua, and had two
services in the native language on the Sabbath.
We really enjoyed these meetings
with the natives, and constantly exclaimed,
"What hath God wrought!" Only a
few years ago, these islands were in the
depths of barbarism and idolatry; now,
what a change! The people are well
dressed; in the house of God they are
respectful and attentive, have their own
deacons, their own choir, are intelligent.
Most of them can read, and when the text
was given out, or a chapter read, often the
Bible would be opened to the place, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
they would follow the reading with great
apparent interest.</p>

<p>On Monday the younger members of the
party rode to a grove about eight miles distant
to get tree-shells, and brought home
quite a number.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning we started for Kualoa.
Grandpa and grandma rode in Mr. Emerson's
wagon drawn by two horses; the rest
of us were on horseback. The roads were
good, our spirits excellent, and the weather
fine; so, of course, all was well. Mr.
Charles H. Judd met us with his double
team about five miles out, and we lunched
at Mr. Moffatt's. Mr. Moffatt is an Englishman,
who has here a fine place, and large
herds of cattle. He has a pretty bathing-place
near the house, perhaps twenty feet
in diameter, half in sunlight, half in a
grotto, with delicate ferns almost hiding the
rock.</p>

<p>There were several peacocks sunning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
themselves on a wall near the house; but
none of them condescended to spread their
beautiful feathers for us to admire. Before
the house are two large stone idols, the
only ones we saw on the islands.</p>

<p>"Are they worshiped, aunty?" asked
Alice.</p>

<p>No, they are placed there as curiosities.</p>

<p>Grandpa and Mr. Judd had an engagement,
and started before us. Grandma rode
in Mr. Judd's wagon, and we left Mr. Moffatt's
about two.</p>

<h2><a name="XVIII" id="XVIII"></a>XVIII.<br /><br />

Oahu.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapt"><span class="dropcap">T</span></span>HE next day at four, I took
my customary seat, surrounded
by my little group,
and resumed my narrative.</p>



<p style="margin-top: 2em;">About ten miles from
Kahuku, at Hauula, is a
church with a native pastor,&mdash;Mr.
Kuaia. We attended a meeting
there, and afterward dined at his house.
He is a well-educated and gentlemanly
man, and his wife an interesting woman.
They live in a neat grass house, furnished
simply but comfortably in American style.
The dinner passed off in a very satisfactory<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
manner. They had pretty wreaths prepared
for us; some were made of a small
orange-colored apple, others of yellow marigolds
strung on a cord. After dinner we
rode another ten miles, and were tired
enough with our long day's ride to sleep
well.</p>

<p>The next morning we rode over to the
house of a friend to see the lassoing of
cattle. The house was on quite an eminence,
so that we had a good view of a
level plain before it. A herd of cattle
were driven into the valley, and three gentlemen
on trained horses, with lassos in
their hands, each selected their animal, and
started in pursuit. It seemed as if in an
instant the creature knew it was hunted,
for it would move from place to place, and
then start on a run, endeavoring to elude
its pursuers; but the horseman, never for a
moment losing sight of his prey, galloped
on, turning this way and that as the crea<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ture
did, until near enough, and then the
lasso sped through the air coiling round
and round the poor animal's legs, generally
throwing him on his knees. Then the
hunter leaped from his saddle, the intelligent
horse standing still, and the lasso was
drawn tighter and tighter until the animal
fell on his side. Finally, a rope was
tied round the hind legs, and the work was
done. It was very exciting, as once in a
while a horse would stumble and fall, sometimes
throwing his rider; and oftentimes
the chase was long, the animal eluding the
hunter's grasp just as he thought he had
cornered him.</p>

<p>"Oh, I wish I had been there!" said
Harry.</p>

<p>Yes, I don't doubt that you would have
enjoyed it; but I felt so sorry for the poor
cattle that it tired me.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, we young people went
on an excursion of about twenty miles on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
horseback to see the Falls of Ka Liuwaa.
After passing about eight miles on the
beach, we turned up a mountain ravine;
two miles more brought us to the end of
our ride. We dismounted and had a lunch,
sitting in the branches of a fallen kukui-tree,
and drinking water from a cup made
of a taro leaf. We took off our riding-skirts,
threw them over the saddle, and
leaving our horses in the care of a native
man, walked up the narrow gorge, or gulch,
as they call it here, seldom more than one
or two hundred feet wide, with precipitous
sides rising sometimes a thousand feet above
us. At times we were just on the edge of
the stream, but as often jumping from rock
to rock in the very bed of the brook. Towards
the termination of the gorge, is a
place in the rock called "The Canoe," a
half-circle gouged right down the precipice
as smooth as if chiseled out, about fifty feet
wide, and a thousand feet deep.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why do they call it '<i>The Canoe</i>'?"
asked Willie.</p>

<p>There is a story connected with it, as
with everything on these islands. One of
their gods was angry with another god, and
sought to kill him. I believe the latter,
who was running away, slipped his canoe
down the rock, making the groove I have
described, and escaped to the sea.</p>

<p>Soon we came to the fall itself, and here
the precipices on each side were one and
two thousand feet high. The fall is about
a hundred feet, running through a narrow
gulch from a lake above, and probably
never was seen by a foreign eye. It was
a lovely and romantic place. The water
fell into a small, but deep, circular pond.
Exquisite varieties of ferns and mosses grew
upon the rocks lining its sides, and no sound
was heard but the plashing of water.</p>

<p>Some of the natives are said to have a
superstitious fear of the place, the remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
of their old religion; and the way up was
lined with offerings, consisting of a leaf
with a few stones piled on it. I don't believe
they are much afraid, for they laughed
if the stones were thrown over.</p>

<p>The next day we rode on fifteen miles to
Kaneohe. Here we met Rev. Mr. Parker's
people. On our way we passed several
rice-fields. Rice is grown in wet places,
like the taro. It looks very much like
grain as you see it in the distance, but it
is of a very brilliant green.</p>

<p>Early the next morning we left for Honolulu.
Soon after we started, our baggage-horse
ran away. One of the bags which
he bore got loose and frightened him.
Our horses saw him coming with one bag
swinging back and forth under his body,
and began to be uneasy, so we turned them
off to the side of the road, and he rushed
past us. The gentlemen and natives started
in pursuit. The poor horse crossed a river,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
and was finally caught in a taro-patch. Our
bags were torn to pieces, and many of their
contents scattered over the plain; some
were wet through or stained with the green
mud from the taro-fields.</p>

<p>"Did you find all your things?" asked
Harry.</p>

<p>Almost everything; the poor horse looked
sadly jaded and tired, but he had to carry
the baggage the rest of the way.</p>

<p>We rode up a precipitous ascent two or
three thousand feet high, by a zigzag road
cut into its sides. The adjacent precipices
are some of them much higher. Over one
of these Kamehameha I. drove the defeated
warriors of Oahu, in his last battle on the
island. That was savage warfare. The
precipice up which we rode is called
"The Pali," or precipice; it is at the head
of Nuuanu valley. The finest approach to
it is from Honolulu. Masses of rock rise
high above you on either side, while a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
beautiful panorama of hills, valleys, cottages,
winding streams, and verdant plantations
all opens to your astonished eye, and
bounding the distant view is the ocean.</p>

<p>Riding down Nuuanu valley, we were
again surrounded by our Honolulu friends.
Our tour of the Hawaiian Islands was
ended.</p>

<p>The next day, May 30, the steamer Kilauea
came into port, bringing missionaries
from the other islands to attend the general
meeting appointed to be held in Honolulu
in the month of June.</p>

<p>The meeting opened June 3, and every
morning and afternoon there were business
meetings until the 16th, when the examination
of Oahu College at Punahou commenced.
It was a fine examination,&mdash;the
same studies as in our New England academies.
It lasted through two days, and on
the third day there was an exhibition in the
evening at the stone church. The house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
was prettily decorated, the king lending
his royal reception-flag for the occasion, an
enormous banner forty feet long. This was
suspended by the four corners from the
ceiling, forming a sort of canopy over the
platform. There were also American,
French, British, Spanish, and Hawaiian
flags, together with wreaths, mottoes, and
bouquets. The church was crowded with
foreigners and natives. The speeches were
good, the young men doing themselves
credit, and the singing was fine; indeed,
there are some superior singers in Honolulu.
Commencement ended, as in our
own country, with the president's levee.
Everybody seemed to be present, and to
enjoy themselves, and did ample justice to
the abundant collation spread in the college
hall. The evening closed with patriotic
songs, and thus ended the college year
of 1863.</p>

<p>General meeting was resumed after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
exercises at Punahou were concluded. Almost
every missionary was present, and had
brought a part or the whole of his family.
The Pastor of the Foreign Church, the
Seamen's Chaplain, President of Oahu College,
native pastors and delegates were all
present. It was delightful to witness the
harmony pervading this large body, and
to see how strong the Christian and missionary
tie that bound them together.
There they sat day after day, exchanging
their opinions, discussing questions,
and settling matters of great importance
to them and the people, meeting and praying
together, and it seemed as if the spirit
of Christ rested upon them; for no jar or
discord was allowed to enter.</p>

<p>The work of the Lord in those islands is
very great. There are now only 67,000
inhabitants, and yet in these forty-three
years in which the mission has been in
operation there have been 52,413 converts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
and 19,679 are now connected with the
churches. Surely, this may be called
a Christian nation. There was another
"Cousins' Meeting" on the evening of
June 6th. I wish you could peep in upon
one of these gatherings. Thirty or forty
young people together, all united by the
missionary tie, the ladies wearing light or
white muslins, with gay belts and sashes,
flowers in their hair, and happy, joyous,
faces; the gentlemen with a rose in their
button-hole, in summer dress; windows,
doors, and blinds all open; and after the
business of the meeting is over, numerous
happy couples promenading to and fro on
the piazza. All this gives a festive look,
and one has a feeling of interest not felt in
gatherings in our own land. At parties
there, one never expected a greater variety
of refreshments than cake, coffee, and
strawberries; so they can be conducted
without much expense, and little companies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
are the order of the day. Then it is so
easy getting about; no cold winter snows
to trudge through, no chilling wind to guard
against; everybody has a horse or vehicle
of some kind, or his next neighbor has,
and is willing to be neighborly.</p>

<p>But we must leave Honolulu parties,
and go to an American supper.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XIX" id="XIX"></a>XIX.<br /><br />

Honolulu again.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>EE little Alice came for
me, with her bright face,
at four o'clock next day,
to lead me to my accustomed
seat in the sitting-room,
where my
happy little group were
always awaiting me.</p>



<p style="margin-top: 2em;">The general meeting occupied most of
the days until three o'clock, and we ladies
took our sewing and listened to the grave
debates. It was an interesting season to
all present.</p>

<p>Half a dozen of us started on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
one afternoon, to visit Kalihe valley, one
of the beautiful gulches near Honolulu; but
when we reached the entrance of the valley,
it rained so that we could not explore
its charms. But we turned off to the residence
of an aged blind man, and rambled
in his garden among peach, orange, and
mango-trees, and then sat on the piazza
eating mangoes and chatting for an hour.
One of the most valued trees in this whole
garden was a little dwarf apple-tree, with
two good-sized apples on it. Those were
some of the first ever grown on the islands,
I believe. After our mango feast, we had
a brisk gallop back to the town.</p>

<p>One day we occupied in making wreaths
and mottoes to decorate the schoolhouse,
where the annual meeting of the Cousins'
Society was to be held in the evening.
Over the middle window, opposite the door,
were the letters "X L C R" [Excelsior],
and below were a wreath and festoon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
with pendants intermixed with beautiful
flowers. On either side, was "<span class="smcap">Unity</span>,
1852" [when the society was formed], and
"<span class="smcap">Harmony</span>, 1863." In the arch of each
window hung a wreath of maile, a pretty
green vine. Between each window was a
tin candle-stand, trimmed with the vine
and flowers. Over the door were four
small American flags intertwined with one
Hawaiian flag. The reports of the officers
were read, and various addresses made, and
"Unity" and "Harmony" were the watch-words
of the meeting. We had one more
meeting at the schoolhouse, when grandpa
addressed the Cousins, reminding them of
the responsibility resting on them; that as
their fathers laid the burden down, they
must take it up, and be to the Hawaiian
people a help and support. They answered
that they were ready and willing,
and, God helping them, they would try and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
be faithful to the people committed to their
care.</p>

<p>The last part of our stay in Honolulu
we spent at the hospitable house of Mrs.
Chamberlain, one of the oldest buildings in
Honolulu. The house was in a very sunny
spot, and was of stone. Pretty little lizards
used to come out of their hiding-places and
sun themselves, and I often watched them
as they played about.</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they hurt you?" asked timid
little Alice.</p>

<p>Oh, no, indeed! they are perfectly
harmless. They are very small and delicate;
I seldom saw one more than three
or four inches long.</p>

<p>"Do they have snakes on the islands?"
asked Harry.</p>

<p>No, not one; the only poisonous reptiles
are scorpions and centipedes. I saw
only one scorpion. That was at Punahou.
I was sitting in the parlor one day, and saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
a small peculiar-looking creature creeping
towards me on the floor. Some movement
of mine, made it throw its tail up over its
back; then I knew it was a scorpion; for
I had read that the sting was in the tail,
and when frightened, it would throw its tail
over its back ready to strike. One of the
gentlemen killed it.</p>

<p>I saw only two live centipedes. They
are ugly-looking creatures. One dreads a
close contact with them. They run and
twist about as if they felt they were unwelcome
guests.</p>

<p>We had a very pleasant farewell party
at Dr. Judd's, where we met missionary
friends and some of the foreign consuls
and their wives. Once more I explored
the extinct crater of Punchbowl, this time
on horseback, and admired the beautiful
landscape before me when tinged with the
setting sun.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of June 26th, the native<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
women brought us gifts of tapa, necklaces,
corals, etc. It was a suggestion of their
own. They wished us to take home mementoes
of them, and had been planning
it for some time among themselves. Some
of the necklaces were made of beautiful
yellow feathers. Only two of that color
grow on the bird, one under each wing;
so the necklaces are very valuable. Others
were made of hundreds of small braids
of human hair, from which is suspended a
hook made of whale's tooth. Those were
worn in former times only by chiefs.</p>

<p>My last excursion was a ride round the
old crater of Diamond Head. We rode
through the fine, cocoa-nut grove of Waikiki,
drinking from its refreshing fruit, and
then cantered along the sea-beach, nearing
the desolate mountain at every bound. Just
before we reached its base,&mdash;a narrow belt
of sand only separating it from the sea,&mdash;a
party of gayly-dressed natives came one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
by one round a projecting point on the
full gallop. All wore their red and yellow
kehaes, or riding-suits. There were
twenty or more of them, and it seemed
like a streak from a rainbow as they flitted
by.</p>

<p>The nearer we came to Diamond Head,
the more forbidding it looked. Nothing
green is seen upon it; old decaying,
crumbling lava extends from its summit
to its base. Beyond the volcano is a very
ancient burying-ground on the sea-shore,
and as we rode over it, bones were often
seen. We completed the circuit of Diamond
Head, riding a distance of twelve
miles in two hours, and returned quite
refreshed by the excursion.</p>

<p>I then bade adieu to my little horse, who
had served me so faithfully and well. He
bore the name of "Shakspeare," though
usually called by the undignified title of
Rat. Never did a little horse more deserve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
a better name. But then, "What's in a
name?"</p>

<p>On Sabbath afternoon, June 28th, Mr.
Henry H. Parker, the son of a missionary,
was ordained pastor of the congregation
worshiping in the stone church. The
services were very interesting to witness,
but were all in Hawaiian. We had become
quite familiar with the native sentence,
"E pule kakou"&mdash;"Let us pray."
The right hand of fellowship was given
by Rev. Mr. Kuaea, a native minister, and
it was an affecting sight to see those two
young men, one white&mdash;the other dark-skinned,&mdash;clasp
hands in Christian fellowship.</p>

<p>The 30th of June I attended my last
"candy-pull." This is a fashionable amusement
there. The candy is made from
sugar, and is whiter and less sticky than
molasses.</p>

<p>Saturday, July 4th, opened in quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
patriotic manner with the firing of thirteen
cannon. At ten, we went to Fort Street
church, and heard a fine oration from the
pastor, Rev. Mr. Corwin. The church was
decorated with flags. Over the pulpit was
laid a very large and elegant American
flag,&mdash;a silken banner. It seemed like an
American assembly on our nation's birthday.
Early in the afternoon we attended
a picnic on the grounds of Oahu College,
Punahou. Those assembled sat in groups
on the grass, while our Declaration of Independence
was read. Then they adjourned
to a long tent, under which were two tiers
of tables, abundantly laid with a tempting
array of good things, while "the feast of
reason and flow of soul" were supplied by
several patriotic speeches and songs. Thirteen
cannon were fired at noon and night,
and fireworks closed the evening. So you
see how patriotic Americans are abroad.</p>

<p>July 5th was our last Sabbath in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
islands. Grandpa had a farewell meeting
at the stone church in the morning, at
which about twenty-five hundred natives
were present. Grandpa bade them good-by,
and Judge Ii [Ee], one of themselves,
expressed their farewell. Many crowded
round to say their last "aloha." It really
made us feel sad to part from this interesting
people. We longed to labor among
them, and continue the good work so favorably
begun.</p>

<p>Monday morning, July 6th, we went on
board the bark Comet. Farewells were
said; our visit at these islands was ended;
and we were homeward bound.</p>

<p>What happy memories cluster around
that little group of islands in the Pacific!
We received only good deeds and kind
words while there. The houses of missionaries
and foreigners were ever opened to us
in hospitality, and the natives were ready
with a hand-grasp and a hearty "aloha."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>It is only about forty-three years since
the missionaries first went there, and nobody
could read or write, nobody had ever
written in their language, and now&mdash;thanks
to our heavenly Father and the missionaries&mdash;almost
all the natives can do both.</p>

<p>What should we be, if only a little over
forty years ago, our parents had been degraded
heathen, knowing nothing of God,
wandering about as naked and as wicked
as those poor Hawaiians were? We ought
to thank God, both for them and for ourselves,&mdash;for
ourselves, because we were not
born thus, and for them, because the light
of the gospel and of civilization has dawned
upon them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XX" id="XX"></a>XX.<br /><br />

Voyage to San Francisco.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapn"><span class="dropcap">"N</span></span>OW, aunty, tell us about
your homeward voyage,"
said Willie as I made my
appearance in the sitting-room
at the usual time. So
I began:&mdash;</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">Our voyage was a tedious
one, for we had a succession of calms all
the way. It was very discouraging, for we
would be sailing with a good breeze, our
sails all filled; then the wind would die
away, and the sails would flap lazily against
the mast.</p>

<p>Our captain was patient and good-natured,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
and so were we. That shows you the power
of example. If the captain had fumed and
fretted, and wondered why we could not
have a wind, very likely we should have
felt ill-natured and looked cross too, and
have had a very unpleasant time. As it
was, we made the best of our calms, and
hoped for a breeze, and rejoiced even if we
were "making haste slowly."</p>

<p>On the ninth day out, we had some variety,
for a shoal of fish passed us, called
albacoa; we caught a fine large one. A
ship hove in sight, too, and we thought she
had just the name for our calm sailing, the
"All-Serene." She was an English ship,
from Sydney, Australia, and had been sixty
days out. She wanted fresh provisions and
flour; so our captain gave her potatoes, bananas,
and turkeys. Being so much becalmed
ourselves, our captain did not dare
to give them flour, as we might come short,
and they had plenty of hard bread. It quite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
revived our courage, for what were our
nine days compared with their sixty days?
And we had plenty of provisions and good
company.</p>

<p>We saw a great many flying-fish every
day. These are small, and have their forward
fins so long that they serve them as
wings skimming along on the surface of the
water. They looked very silvery in the
sunlight, and I thought at first they were
little white birds.</p>

<p>Several times we saw porpoises, and one
day a shoal of whales was in sight. One
big black fellow leaped out of the water;
we first saw his great head, then his fluked
tail thrown up in the air, as he dived down
to depths beneath. Some of them were
spouting and playing about us, and one
had a young whale with her.</p>

<p>A large shoal of "skip jacks" surrounded
the ship one morning; there must
have been thousands of them!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are <i>skip jacks</i>?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>A pretty blue fish between one and two
feet long; they were mostly blue, but
seemed to change to all colors of the rainbow.
The men fished for them with a
hook covered with a rag, which the fish
were supposed to imagine a flying-fish, and
ten of them were silly enough to be deceived;
so we had a chowder of fresh
fish.</p>

<p>The captain had the galley or cook-room
cleared up for us one afternoon, and we
boiled sugar for candy. He did everything
possible for our comfort, and often sent in
a dish of hot roasted peanuts for us. These
peanuts grew on the Sandwich Islands.
We saw the plant, the leaf of which is very
much like a clover-leaf, and the nut grows
underground on the roots like artichokes.
Kind island friends had given us a large
supply of bananas and pine-apples; so we
had quite a variety on our bill of fare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>On Tuesday, the 28th of July, we came
into water colored and of a lighter shade
than any we had seen. The cause of
this is said to be the immense amount of
mud washed down from the gold-diggings
through the Sacramento River; I can not
say whether this is true or not. We hoped
to get into San Francisco in time to dine the
next day; but a calm dissipated all such
anticipations, and we lay off and on by the
Farallone Islands all the night of the 29th.</p>

<p>We saw a great many diver birds, about
the size of pigeons. While sailing along on
the water, they would all at once dive and
disappear, and remain under water a long
while.</p>

<p>The Farallone Islands are a small group
of rocky islets, lying in the Pacific Ocean,
about thirty-five miles west of San Francisco.
There are two groups of them, the
North and South Farallones, about eight
miles distant from each other. The southern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
islands are the most important. On
the summit of the largest rock, which is
about three hundred and fifty feet high, is
a lighthouse. The only person on the island
is the light-keeper. The islands are
one vast menagerie. Birds of many varieties
make their home here by swarms, and
thousands of sea-lions and seals cover the
rocks.</p>

<span class="caption"><span class="smcap">Sea Lion</span>.&mdash;Page <a href="#Page_213">213</a>.</span>
</div>

<p>"What are <i>sea-lions</i>?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>A species of seal often as large as an ox,
and weighing from two to three thousand
pounds each. They make a very loud
noise, a sort of moaning cry, like "yoi
hoey, yoi hoey." The young seals are of a
dark mouse color, but the older ones are of
a light-brown. At a distance the braying
of these sea-lions sounded like the rumbling
of a railroad train. There is a hole in
the rock on one of these islands, where the
air is drawn through with a sound like the
whistle of a steam-engine.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span></p>

<p>Every spot and foothold on these rocks
seems to be the abode of a bird or seal;
the waters around swarm with life, while
large flocks of birds are coming from every
direction. Vast quantities of eggs are taken
from these rocks and carried to the San
Francisco market every year.</p>

<p>We left the Farallones about three o'clock
in the morning, and when we came on deck,
they were fading in the dim distance.</p>

<p>One of the first objects noticed as we approached
the coast was Fort Point, where
is a massive fortification, well mounted with
heavy guns. Between this point and Lime
Point is the celebrated Golden Gate, which
is about a mile wide and is the entrance
into the bay of San Francisco. Connected
with Fort Point is a lighthouse and fog-bell;
the latter is always rung during foggy
weather.</p>

<p>In the bay just opposite the Golden Gate,
and about three and a half miles from Fort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
Point, is Alcatraces Island. It commands
the entrance to the great bay of San Francisco.
About the center of the island is a
large building which may be used for barracks
or a citadel. A belt of batteries encircles
the island, and it seems to be defended
at every point. There is a lighthouse
and fog-bell on this island also.</p>

<p>Soon after passing Alcatraces Island, we
came to anchor near Mission Street wharf.
We waited for the custom-house officer to
come on board. After a short detention
we went down the ship's ladder into a small
boat, and were soon on shore. Half an
hour's ride brought us to the Lick House,
and the journey to the Hawaiian Islands
was among the things of the past. Though
so far away from home and friends, we
were in the United States, and under our
own beloved flag.</p>

<p>We did not forget to thank the Father
of mercies for his kind care of us when on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
the deep, and beseech him to continue his
loving-kindness to us while in that far-off
part of our great country. Friends gathered
about us with their warm greetings,
and we soon left the hotel and took up our
abode in a quiet family circle. But our
hearts began to hasten our departure for
our eastern home.</p>

California.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapw"><span class="dropcap">W</span></span>E took one day a very
pleasant drive out to
the Cliff House. Opposite
this hotel, which
is just on the beach,
are some craggy rocks,
which are entirely covered
with seals and sea-lions.
They are so near that you can
see them playing in the water, which
seems to be alive with them, while their
mournful cry echoes in your ears, "yoi
hoey, yoi hoey." We took quite a drive
on the beach, and saw many little "Portuguese<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
men-of-war," which had been washed
up on the sand. They are a sort of stiff
jelly fishes, in shape resembling a wafer,
with the half of another wafer set up
across the center like a sail. We used
to see thousands of them floating on the
water when at sea. It was quite interesting
to watch some little birds, which ran
along so swiftly on the sand that they
seemed to glide without any movement
of their feet. They looked brown, but
when they flew, their breasts and the under
part of their wings were snowy
white; and as their wings vibrated quickly,
the sudden alternation of brown and
white had a very pretty effect.</p>

<p>At four o'clock on the afternoon of August
5th, we started for Sacramento, on
the steamer Yo Semite. The steamer was
named for a beautiful valley in California.
The first object of interest we passed was
Alcatraces Island, with its circle of batteries;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
but our chief attention was bestowed
upon the city left behind us and the shipping,&mdash;the
larger craft lying at anchor, or
changing their position, and the smaller
boats flitting here and there in the bay.
Passing several islands, we entered San
Pablo Bay [St. Paul]. The scenery on
either side was interesting, but soon, passing
through the Straits of Carquinez, we were
in Suisun Bay, and neared the city of Benicia.
An arsenal, barracks for soldiers, and
the works of the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company are located here. While sailing
in this bay, we had a good view of Monte
Diablo, a high and lonely mountain which
seems to be the landmark for all the country
round. We passed the San Joaquin
River, and soon entered the Sacramento
River, a muddy, turbid stream. All the
mud from the mines is washed into this
river, and pours down into the bay, and
from thence to the ocean, coloring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
water for a long distance out to sea. We
passed by vast quantities of <i>tules</i> or rushes,
which cover the surface of the water for
miles. Our arrival at Sacramento was
about midnight, but we remained on board
the boat until morning, and then went to
the Vernon House. After breakfast we
walked a short distance up the river to a
fine bridge about nine hundred feet long.</p>

<p>After lunch we took the cars for Folsom,
twenty miles from Sacramento, accompanied
by a friend. We passed into the mining
district, and at Folsom took a carriage.
It was warm and dusty riding, as there is
no rain in the summer in that section of
California. After an hour's ride, reached
Willow Springs, where were the mines we
had come to see. This was an hydraulic
mine; that is, it is worked by water. We
clambered about in the excavation, saw
the bed rock, upon which there is a layer
of gold-bearing gravel, then one of clay,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
another of gold-bearing gravel, then of clay
again, and one more of gravel. They play
with a hose on the gravel, and the water
and gravel is washed down through long
sluices, the bottom of which is made uneven
by blocks of wood placed across.
The bits of gold lodge on the uneven
surface. In some places they cut down
the gravel with pickaxes, and wash it in
pans. One man washed out a spadeful of
gravel for us, and we brought home a few
specks of gold dust. We returned to Sacramento
to dine, and after dinner I rode out
to the Fair grounds, where the great State
agricultural fairs are held. This is the
fashionable drive in Sacramento in the
afternoon. Here is a fine drive of a mile,
outside of which are stalls for cattle. A
gentleman told us that in 1849 he sold flour
for three hundred dollars a barrel; and
bought potatoes for a dollar and a half a
pound. That was when California was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
first known as a gold country, and so many
people went thither to seek their fortunes.</p>

<p>The next morning, Mr. M., one of our
fellow-passengers from New York to San
Francisco took us a delightful drive about
the city and suburbs. We saw the levees,
which were erected to save the city from
another flood.</p>

<p>"What are <i>levees</i>?" asked Willie.</p>

<p>They are heavy banks of earth built along
the margin of the stream. The last flood
took place in the winter, on December 9,
1861, and January 10, 1862. The whole
city was flooded. The water rose over the
table in the dining-room of the hotel in
which we stayed. Houses could be reached
only in boats, and no one knew how soon his
dwelling might be undermined and fall. A
great deal of the fertile land about Sacramento
was ruined by the flood, being covered
with a deep layer of gravel.</p>

<p>We saw the new capitol which is in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
process of erection, and a large, handsome
structure it will be. We passed near Sutter's
Fort, where it was first discovered that
there were gold mines in this country.</p>

<p>In 1853, the city spread over about as
much ground as it now does, when it was
destroyed by fire. The climate of Sacramento
is very different from that of San
Francisco, being much warmer. It is so
far from the coast that it escapes the chilling
wind that visits the latter city at certain
seasons of the year.</p>

<p>In the afternoon we went on board the
steamer Chrysopolis bound for San Francisco.
We went through a slough (or, as
the people pronounce it, <i>slew</i>) in the river
about seven miles long.</p>

<p>"What is a <i>slough</i>?" asked Alice.</p>

<p>There was a long bend in the river, of
fourteen miles, so they cut a sort of canal
across it, and half the distance was saved.
This canal they call a slough.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. M. told us that in one of the early
years of the gold excitement, there was an
old man who had watermelons that were in
great demand, sometimes selling for five
dollars apiece. The next year a great many
people wanted the seed to plant; these were
sold for sixteen dollars per ounce, but not
one came up; so they suppose he boiled the
seeds before he sold them! We arrived at
San Francisco towards midnight. At noon
on Saturday we took the steamboat for
Oakland, which is across the bay from San
Francisco. It took its name from the number
of oak-trees growing there. They give
a green and pleasant appearance to the
country round. California College is situated
in Oakland.</p>

<p>On Sabbath we had the pleasure in
the morning of listening to a sermon
from an old friend, and in the evening
grandpa told the people of what God
had wrought through the missionaries in
the Sandwich Islands.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>Monday morning we were taken a long
ride over the country about Oakland. On
our way back, we stopped at Mr. B.'s orchard,
and had some very nice plums,
white and purple. There were nectarines,
also, which have the skin of a plum
and the stone of a peach; apricots, which
have the skin of a peach and stone of a
plum; I never knew the difference in
those two fruits before. We had some
delicious peaches, and brought away a
branch of the almond-tree, with the nuts
on it, which looked like green peaches.
We then took the Oakland boat and were
soon at our home in San Francisco. California
is noted for its fine fruits, and sometimes
we saw baskets of assorted kinds
looking like those fine paintings we admire
so much.</p>

<p>On Thursday, August 13, we bade our
kind and hospitable California friends farewell,
and went down to embark on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
steamer Golden Age. The kindness of
our friends did not end when we left their
houses, as beautiful bouquets and baskets
of fruit in our staterooms testified. We
parted from them with regret, for we had
received nothing but kindness from their
hands. Farewells were said, and San Francisco
soon faded from our sight. We were
again on the restless ocean, but we were
<i>homeward bound</i>!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span></p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="XXII" id="XXII"></a>XXII.<br /><br />

Homeward Bound.</h2>


<p><span class="dropcapa"><span class="dropcap">"A</span></span>UNTY, aunty, please come
and tell us our story," said
little Alice; "we are all
waiting. You know this is
our last story, for we go
home to-morrow." So down
I went.</p>


<p style="margin-top: 2em;">We were fairly at sea again. Our
steamer was a very good one, and we had
pleasant accommodations. Grandpa and
grandma had a fine, large stateroom, and
as there were not a great number of passengers,
I, also, had a stateroom all to
myself. I had the lower berth taken out,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
and my trunks brought up and placed
under my berth; then I spread down my
rug, and brought in my deck chair, and
my room had quite a cozy, homelike air;
and I took a great deal of comfort in it.
The officers on the boat were very pleasant,
and we became acquainted with some of
the passengers.</p>

<p>On Sabbath morning, eight of the younger
people met together and formed a choir,
practiced sacred music, and sung in the
morning service, when Rev. Mr. McMonagle
preached. In the afternoon we went
to the forward part of the steamer, and
grandpa preached to the steerage passengers,
on "Christ in the ship in the storm."
The choir sung, and the poor people looked
so gratified and pleased to have preaching
and singing that it did one's heart good.</p>

<p>We used to sing songs almost every
evening, and it was very pleasant as we sat
on the quarter-deck looking off on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
water. The moon cast her radiance over
the ocean; the white foam, in a long line
back, marked our track; and the brilliant
stars, seeming far brighter than they do in
our northern heavens, looked like diamonds
in God's firmament. We sailed along easily
and smoothly until the morning of August
30, when we were wakened early by the
rolling of the ship, and found a hurricane
upon us. It was almost impossible to
dress, but after being tossed against both
sides of my stateroom several times, I succeeded.
What a dismal scene met my
eye as I opened my door! Carpets rolled
up, sofas and chairs piled in together, the
marble tops of the tables taken off and
lashed to the floor, skylights leaking, so
that we had to choose our footing carefully,
or the slippery floors and the ship's
rolling would soon bring us down to the
floor. On every hand crashes were heard
from unlucky lamp-shades, bottles, pitchers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
or anything breakable that was not
properly secured. The waves seemed mountain
high, and the wind was so strong that
their crests were blown off in spray.</p>

<p>After a while the captain ordered us
all below. The scene in the lower cabin
was dismal in the extreme. Passengers&mdash;many
of them only half dressed, most of
them pale from sea-sickness or fear&mdash;all
crowded together on the sofas on one side
of the saloon; for the vessel lay over so
that we could sit only on one row of
sofas. A dozen people, perhaps, were
leaning over the backs of the sofas at
one time, all sea-sick. Children were crying
from hunger or fright. What a scene!
We shipped wave after wave with a shock
that made the vessel tremble from stem
to stern. Crash followed crash. At one
time the cases filled with dishes in the
pantry gave way, and what a noise of
broken crockery! Three enormous baskets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
were filled with the pieces. One of
the bulkheads was knocked out, and eleven
sheep were washed overboard. The butcher's
shop was washed away, and two barrels
of beef, one of mackerel, and one
of table butter went with the rest. The
heavy stoves in the steerage cook-room
were turned half-way round, and the capping
of the huge smokestack was moved
several inches. The terrible wind lifted
the hurricane-deck, so that six of its props
fell out. There was danger of the upper
deck and stateroom being blown away.
That was a time to try people's souls, to
make them consider whether they were
the Lord's or not. It was a blessed thing
to feel that we were in God's hands, that
even if the water closed over our bodies,
it would be only the gate of heaven!
What happiness to be able to feel in
one's heart: "My Father rules the storm."
Many of us thought of grandpa's sermon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
on the Sabbath, when he said, "With
Christ in the ship, we may smile at the
storm."</p>

<p>The wind was so violent that the men
doing duty on deck had to lie down, and
pull themselves about, or creep on their
hands and knees. For two hours our
forward rail was three feet under water,
the vessel lay so much on one side,
and for some time the ship would not
mind her helm, and lay in the trough of
the sea. Finally, they rigged a small sail
aft, and that brought her up. He who
rules the wind and the sea caused the
storm to abate, and towards evening it was
comparatively calm. We had had nothing
to eat for twenty-four hours, which will
give you some idea of the storm. Staterooms
and clothes were in many instances
wet; but no one complained, for
all felt thankful for our escape. In the
evening there was a meeting in the saloon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
and almost all the passengers assembled
with the officers of the vessel to give
thanks to God for his preserving mercy.</p>

<p>The next morning I rose early, so that
I might see the entrance to Acapulco Harbor.
This entrance is very narrow, and is
surrounded by high wooded hills, forming
one of the best harbors on the Pacific
coast, south of San Francisco. I went on
shore again; but I gave you a description
of the place before.</p>

<p>August 27 found us at anchor off Panama.
We were sorry to leave our good
ship and her pleasant corps of officers.
When we were in the cars, the natives
brought a great many things to sell. One
man would have ear-rings, the next wine,
then "nice lomonard," or little ornaments
of pearl-shell, while others brought fruit
and cakes. After a tiresome hour, we
started on our journey across the Isthmus.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>

<p>One thing that attracted my attention
was the telegraph-posts; they looked like
stone, but were made of concrete.</p>

<p>"What is <i>concrete</i>?" asked Harry.</p>

<p>In this instance, I suppose it was a composition
made of pounded stone and cement
cast in a mold. The mold was filled
in with concrete and left for several days.
The reason of their having such posts was
that the worms destroyed the wooden ones.</p>

<p>The natives brought into the cars some
beautiful flowers. They were of alabaster
whiteness, in shape not unlike a tulip, and
having a strong perfume somewhat like
the magnolia. Resting within the cup of
the flower, lies the perfect image of a
dove, with its beautifully formed wings
spread out from its side, its head bent
forward, and its tiny bill delicately tipped
with red almost touching its snowy breast.
No one who has seen the flower can wonder
that the early Spanish Catholics believed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
the flowers to have had a miraculous
origin, and named it "Flor del Espiritu
Santo" or "The Flower of the
Holy Ghost."</p>

<p>Matachin is the largest station on the
Isthmus. There we procured oranges,
which were unusually fine, also cakes tasting
like macaroons, and some bottles of
milk.</p>

<p>Over the Chagres River at Barbacoas,
is a wrought-iron bridge six hundred and
twenty-five feet long and eighteen broad,
standing forty feet above the surface of the
water; it is said to be one of the longest
and finest bridges in the world. All along
the road the sensitive plant, with its feathery
pink blossoms, grew in wild profusion.</p>

<p>At half-past eight in the evening we
were on board the steamer Champion.
We soon commenced our last voyage, and
<i>such</i> a voyage! The vessel rolled, and the
ice in the hold gave out, and in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
the meat was in no fit state to eat.
Every body and every thing seemed uncomfortable.
It was a great change from the
clean and pleasant Golden Age. We
saw the islands of San Domingo, Narvasa,
Jamaica, Cuba, Santa Inagua, and
Mayo Guano, of the West Indies.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 3, we
were chased by a steamer. She was under
sail when we first saw her, but commenced
getting up steam. She lost time
in that operation, and we outsailed her,
much to our joy. Our captain said without
doubt she was a privateer.</p>

<p>Next day we were in the Gulf Stream.
It was rough, squally, and rainy, and the
steamer rolled worse than ever. But all
things come to an end, and the next day
was bright and pleasant. We left the
Gulf Stream in the night and were happy
in a smooth sea. Six or seven ships
were in sight, and in the afternoon we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
passed Barnegat Lighthouse, then Highland
Light. We saw the lights in the hotels
at Long Branch, and finally the light on
Sandy Hook beamed on our delighted eyes.</p>

<p>At two o'clock Sabbath morning, September
6, we lay at anchor off quarantine, and
at five we were at the wharf in New York,&mdash;our
voyage ended. After much delay
and confusion, we got ourselves and baggage
on and in a carriage, and soon
were receiving the greetings of friends.</p>

<p>Surely, we ought to sing with our whole
hearts that beautiful hymn of Addison:&mdash;</p>
